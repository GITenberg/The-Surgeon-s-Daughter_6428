      INTRODUCTION.&mdash;(1831.)
    </h2>
    <p>
      The tale of the Surgeon's Daughter formed part of the second series of
      Chronicles of the Canongate, published in 1827; but has been separated
      from the stories of the Highland Widow, &amp;c., which it originally
      accompanied, and deferred to the close of this collection, for reasons
      which printers and publishers will understand, and which would hardly
      interest the general reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Author has nothing to say now in reference to this little Novel, but
      that the principal incident on which it turns, was narrated to him one
      morning at breakfast by his worthy friend, Mr. Train, of Castle Douglas,
      in Galloway, whose kind assistance he has so often had occasion to
      acknowledge in the course of these prefaces; and that the military friend
      who is alluded to as having furnished him with some information as to
      Eastern matters, was Colonel James Ferguson of Huntly Burn, one of the
      sons of the venerable historian and philosopher of that name&mdash;which
      name he took the liberty of concealing under its Gaelic form of <i>Mac-Erries</i>.

      APPENDIX TO INTRODUCTION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      [Mr. Train was requested by Sir Walter Scott to give him in writing the
      story as nearly as possible in the shape in which he had told it; but the
      following narrative, which he drew up accordingly, did not reach
      Abbotsford until July 1832]
    </p>
    <p>
      In the old Stock of Fife, there was not perhaps an individual whose
      exertions were followed by consequences of such a remarkable nature as
      those of Davie Duff, popularly called &ldquo;The Thane of Fife,&rdquo; who, from a
      very humble parentage, rose to fill one of the chairs of the magistracy of
      his native burgh. By industry and economy in early life, he obtained the
      means of erecting, solely on his own account, one of those ingenious
      manufactories for which Fifeshire is justly celebrated. From the day on
      which the industrious artisan first took his seat at the Council Board, he
      attended so much to the interests of the little privileged community, that
      civic honours were conferred on him as rapidly as the Set of the Royalty
      [Footnote: The Constitution of the Borough.] could legally admit.
    </p>
    <p>
      To have the right of walking to church on holy-days, preceded by a phalanx
      of halberdiers, in habiliments fashioned as in former times, seems, in the
      eyes of many a guild brother, to be a very enviable pitch of worldly
      grandeur. Few persons were ever more proud of civic honours than the Thane
      of Fife, but he knew well how to turn his political influence to the best
      account. The council, court, and other business of the burgh, occupied
      much of his time, which caused him to intrust the management of his
      manufactory to a near relation, whose name was D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, a
      young man of dissolute habits; but the Thane, seeing at last, that by
      continuing that extravagant person in that charge, his affairs would, in
      all probability, fall into a state of bankruptcy, applied to the member of
      Parliament for that district to obtain a situation for his relation in the
      civil department of the state. The knight, whom it is here unnecessary to
      name, knowing how effectually the Thane ruled the little burgh, applied in
      the proper quarter, and actually obtained an appointment for D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      in the civil service of the East India Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      A respectable surgeon, whose residence was in a neighbouring village, had
      a beautiful daughter named Emma, who had long been courted by D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
      Immediately before his departure to India, as a mark of mutual affection,
      they exchanged miniatures, taken by an eminent artist in Fife, and each
      set in a locket, for the purpose of having the object of affection always
      in view.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the old Thane were now turned towards Hindostan with much
      anxiety; but his relation had not long arrived in that distant quarter of
      the globe before he had the satisfaction of receiving a letter, conveying
      the welcome intelligence of his having taken possession of his new station
      in a large frontier town of the Company's dominions, and that great
      emoluments were attached to the situation; which was confirmed by several
      subsequent communications of the most gratifying description to the old
      Thane, who took great pleasure in spreading the news of the reformed
      habits and singular good fortune of his intended heir. None of all his
      former acquaintances heard with such joy the favourable report of the
      successful adventurer in the East, as did the fair and accomplished
      daughter of the village surgeon; but his previous character caused her to
      keep her own correspondence with him secret from her parents, to whom even
      the circumstance of her being acquainted with D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; was
      wholly unknown, till her father received a letter from him, in which he
      assured him of his attachment to Emma long before his departure from Fife;
      that having been so happy as to gain her affections, he would have made
      her his wife before leaving his native country, had he then had the means
      of supporting her in a suitable rank through life; and that, having it now
      in his power to do so, he only waited the consent of her parents to fulfil
      the vow he had formerly made.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor having a large family, with a very limited income to support
      them, and understanding that D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; had at last become a
      person of sober and industrious habits, he gave his consent, in which
      Emma's mother fully concurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aware of the straitened circumstances of the Doctor, D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      remitted a sum of money to complete at Edinburgh Emma's Oriental
      education, and fit her out in her journey to India; she was to embark at
      Sheerness, on board one of the Company's ships, for a port in India, at
      which place, he said, he would wait her arrival, with a retinue suited to
      a person of his rank in society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma set out from her father's house just in time to secure a passage, as
      proposed by her intended husband, accompanied by her only brother, who, on
      their arrival at Sheerness, met one C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, an old
      schoolfellow, captain of the ship by which Emma was to proceed to India.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the particular desire of the Doctor that his daughter should be
      committed to the care of that gentleman, from the time of her leaving the
      shores of Britain, till the intended marriage ceremony was duly performed
      on her arrival in India; a charge that was frankly undertaken by the
      generous sea-captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the arrival of the fleet at the appointed port, D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      with a large cavalcade of mounted Pindarees, was, as expected, in
      attendance, ready to salute Emma on landing, and to carry her direct into
      the interior of the country. C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, who had made several
      voyages to the shores of Hindostan, knowing something of Hindoo manners
      and customs, was surprised to see a private individual in the Company's
      service with so many attendants; and when D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; declined
      having the marriage ceremony performed according to the rites of the
      Church, till he returned to the place of his abode, C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      more and more confirmed in his suspicion that all was not right, resolved
      not to part with Emma till he had fulfilled, in the most satisfactory
      manner, the promise he had made before leaving England, of giving her duly
      away in marriage. Not being able by her entreaties to alter the resolution
      of D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, Emma solicited her protector C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      to accompany her to the place of her intended destination, to which he
      most readily agreed, taking with him as many of his crew as he deemed
      sufficient to ensure the safe custody of his innocent protege, should any
      attempt be made to carry her away by force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both parties journeyed onwards till they arrived at a frontier town, where
      a native Rajah was waiting the arrival of the fair maid of Fife, with whom
      he had fallen deeply in love, from seeing her miniature likeness in the
      possession of D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, to whom he had paid a large sum of
      money for the original, and had only intrusted him to convey her in state
      to the seat of his government.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner was this villanous action of D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; known to C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      than he communicated the whole particulars to the commanding officer of a
      regiment of Scotch Highlanders that happened to be quartered in that part
      of India, begging at the same time, for the honour of Caledonia, and
      protection of injured innocence, that he would use the means in his power,
      of resisting any attempt that might be made by the native chief to wrest
      from their hands the virtuous female who had been so shamefully decoyed
      from her native country by the worst of mankind. Honour occupies too large
      a space in the heart of the Gael to resist such a call of humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rajah, finding his claim was not to be acceded to, and resolving to
      enforce the same, assembled his troops, and attacked with great fury the
      place where the affrighted Emma was for a time secured by her countrymen,
      who fought in her defence with all their native valour, which at length so
      overpowered their assailants, that they were forced to retire in every
      direction, leaving behind many of their slain, among whom was found the
      mangled corpse of the perfidious D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; was immediately afterwards married to Emma, and my
      informant assured me he saw them many years afterwards, living happily
      together in the county of Kent, on the fortune bequeathed by the &ldquo;Thane of
      Fife.&rdquo;

      MR. CROFTANGRY'S PREFACE.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Indite, my muse indite,
    Subpoena'd is thy lyre,
  The praises to requite
    Which rules of court require.
               PROBATIONARY ODES.
</pre>
    <p>
      The concluding a literary undertaking, in whole or in part, is, to the
      inexperienced at least, attended with an irritating titillation, like that
      which attends on the healing of a wound&mdash;a prurient impatience, in
      short, to know what the world in general, and friends in particular, will
      say to our labours. Some authors, I am told, profess an oyster-like
      indifference upon this subject; for my own part, I hardly believe in their
      sincerity. Others may acquire it from habit; but, in my poor opinion, a
      neophyte like myself must be for a long time incapable of such <i>sang
      froid</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frankly, I was ashamed to feel how childishly I felt on the occasion. No
      person could have said prettier things than myself upon the importance of
      stoicism concerning the opinion of others, when their applause or censure
      refers to literary character only; and I had determined to lay my work
      before the public, with the same unconcern with which the ostrich lays her
      eggs in the sand, giving herself no farther trouble concerning the
      incubation, but leaving to the atmosphere to bring forth the young, or
      otherwise, as the climate shall serve. But though an ostrich in theory, I
      became in practice a poor hen, who has no sooner made her deposit, but she
      runs cackling about, to call the attention of every one to the wonderful
      work which she has performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I became possessed of my first volume, neatly stitched up and
      boarded, my sense of the necessity of communicating with some one became
      ungovernable. Janet was inexorable, and seemed already to have tired of my
      literary confidence; for whenever I drew near the subject, after evading
      it as long as she could, she made, under some pretext or other, a bodily
      retreat to the kitchen or the cockloft, her own peculiar and inviolate
      domains. My publisher would have been a natural resource; but he
      understands his business too well, and follows it too closely, to desire
      to enter into literary discussions, wisely considering, that he who has to
      sell books has seldom leisure to read them. Then my acquaintance, now that
      I have lost Mrs. Bethune Baliol, are of that distant and accidental kind,
      to whom I had not face enough to communicate the nature of my uneasiness,
      and who probably would only have laughed at me had I made any attempt to
      interest them in my labours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reduced thus to a sort of despair, I thought of my friend and man of
      business, Mr. Fairscribe. His habits, it was true, were not likely to
      render him indulgent to light literature, and, indeed, I had more than
      once noticed his daughters, and especially my little songstress, whip into
      her reticule what looked very like a circulating library volume, as soon
      as her father entered the room. Still he was not only my assured, but
      almost my only friend, and I had little doubt that he would take an
      interest in the volume for the sake of the author, which the work itself
      might fail to inspire. I sent him, therefore, the book, carefully sealed
      up, with an intimation that I requested the favour of his opinion upon the
      contents, of which I affected to talk in the depreciatory style, which
      calls for point-blank contradiction, if your correspondent possess a grain
      of civility.
    </p>
    <p>
      This communication took place on a Monday, and I daily expected (what I
      was ashamed to anticipate by volunteering my presence, however sure of a
      welcome) an invitation to eat an egg, as was my friend's favourite phrase,
      or a card to drink tea with Misses Fairscribe, or a provocation to
      breakfast, at least, with my hospitable friend and benefactor, and to talk
      over the contents of my enclosure. But the hours and days passed on from
      Monday till Saturday, and I had no acknowledgment whatever that my packet
      had reached its destination. &ldquo;This is very unlike my good friend's
      punctuality,&rdquo; thought I; and having again and again vexed James, my male
      attendant, by a close examination concerning the time, place, and
      delivery, I had only to strain my imagination to conceive reasons for my
      friend's silence. Sometimes I thought that his opinion of the work had
      proved so unfavourable that he was averse to hurt my feelings by
      communicating it&mdash;sometimes, that, escaping his hands to whom it was
      destined, it had found its way into his writing-chamber, and was become
      the subject of criticism to his smart clerks and conceited apprentices.
      &ldquo;'Sdeath!&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;if I were sure of this, I would&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what would you do?&rdquo; said Reason, after a few moment's reflection.
      &ldquo;You are ambitious of introducing your book into every writing and
      reading-chamber in Edinburgh, and yet you take fire at the thoughts of its
      being criticised by Mr. Fairscribe's young people? Be a little consistent&mdash;for
      shame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be consistent,&rdquo; said I, doggedly; &ldquo;but for all that, I will call
      on Mr. Fairscribe this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hastened my dinner, donn'd my great-coat (for the evening threatened
      rain,) and went to Mr. Fairscribe's house. The old domestic opened the
      door cautiously, and before I asked the question, said, &ldquo;Mr. Fairscribe is
      at home, sir; but it is Sunday night.&rdquo; Recognising, however, my face and
      voice, he opened the door wider, admitted me, and conducted me to the
      parlour, where I found Mr. Fairscribe and the rest of his family engaged
      in listening to a sermon by the late Mr. Walker of Edinburgh, [Footnote:
      Robert Walker, the colleague and rival of Dr. Hugh Blair, in St. Giles's
      Church Edinburgh] which was read by Miss Catherine with unusual
      distinctness, simplicity, and judgment. Welcomed as a friend of the house,
      I had nothing for it but to take my seat quietly, and making a virtue of
      necessity, endeavour to derive my share of the benefit arising from an
      excellent sermon. But I am afraid Mr. Walker's force of logic and
      precision of expression were somewhat lost upon me. I was sensible I had
      chosen an improper time to disturb Mr. Fairscribe, and when the discourse
      was ended, I rose to take my leave, somewhat hastily, I believe. &ldquo;A cup of
      tea, Mr. Croftangry?&rdquo; said the young lady. &ldquo;You will wait and take part of
      a Presbyterian supper?&rdquo; said Mr. Fairscribe.&mdash;&ldquo;Nine o'clock&mdash;I
      make it a point of keeping my father's hours on Sunday at e'en. Perhaps
      Dr.&mdash;&mdash;(naming an excellent clergyman) may look in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made my apology for declining his invitation; and I fancy my unexpected
      appearance, and hasty retreat, had rather surprised my friend, since,
      instead of accompanying me to the door, he conducted me into his own
      apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Mr. Croftangry? This is not a night for
      secular business, but if any thing sudden or extraordinary has happened&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing in the world,&rdquo; said I, forcing myself upon confession, as the
      best way of clearing myself out of the scrape,&mdash;&ldquo;only&mdash;only I
      sent you a little parcel, and as you are so regular in acknowledging
      letters and communications, I&mdash;I thought it might have miscarried&mdash;that's
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My friend laughed heartily, as if he saw into and enjoyed my motives and
      my confusion. &ldquo;Safe?&mdash;it came safe enough,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The wind of the
      world always blows its vanities into haven. But this is the end of the
      session, when I have little time to read any thing printed except
      Inner-House papers; yet if you will take your kail with us next Saturday,
      I will glance over your work, though I am sure I am no competent judge of
      such matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this promise I was fain to take my leave, not without half persuading
      myself that if once the phlegmatic lawyer began my lucubrations, he would
      not be able to rise from them till he had finished the perusal, nor to
      endure an interval betwixt his reading the last page, and requesting an
      interview with the author.
    </p>
    <p>
      No such marks of impatience displayed themselves. Time, blunt or keen, as
      my friend Joanna says, swift or leisurely, held his course; and on the
      appointed Saturday, I was at the door precisely as it struck four. The
      dinner hour, indeed, was five punctually; but what did I know but my
      friend might want half an hour's conversation with me before that time? I
      was ushered into an empty drawing-room, and, from a needle-book and
      work-basket hastily abandoned, I had some reason to think I interrupted my
      little friend, Miss Katie, in some domestic labour more praiseworthy than
      elegant. In this critical age, filial piety must hide herself in a closet,
      if she has a mind to darn her father's linen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after, I was the more fully convinced that I had been too early an
      intruder when a wench came to fetch away the basket, and recommend to my
      courtesies a red and green gentleman in a cage, who answered all my
      advances by croaking out, &ldquo;You're a fool&mdash;you're a fool, I tell you!&rdquo;
       until, upon my word, I began to think the creature was in the right. At
      last my friend arrived, a little overheated. He had been taking a turn at
      golf, to prepare him for &ldquo;colloquy sublime.&rdquo; And wherefore not? since the
      game, with its variety of odds, lengths, bunkers, tee'd balls, and so on,
      may be no inadequate representation of the hazards attending literary
      pursuits. In particular, those formidable buffets, which make one ball
      spin through the air like a rifle-shot, and strike another down into the
      very earth it is placed upon, by the mal-adroitness, or the malicious
      purpose of the player&mdash;what are they but parallels to the favourable
      or depreciating notices of the reviewers, who play at golf with the
      publications of the season, even as Altisidora, in her approach to the
      gates of the infernal regions, saw the devils playing at racket with the
      new books of Cervantes' days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, every hour has its end. Five o'clock came, and my friend, with his
      daughters, and his handsome young son, who, though fairly buckled to the
      desk, is every now and then looking over his shoulder at a smart uniform,
      set seriously about satisfying the corporeal wants of nature; I,
      stimulated by a nobler appetite after fame, wished that the touch of a
      magic wand could, without all the ceremony of picking and choosing,
      carving and slicing, masticating and swallowing, have transported a <i>quantum
      sufficit</i> of the good things on my friend's hospitable board, into the
      stomachs of those who surrounded it, to be there at leisure converted into
      chyle, while their thoughts were turned on higher matters. At length all
      was over. But the young ladies sat still, and talked of the music of the
      Freischutz, for nothing else was then thought of; so we discussed the wild
      hunter's song, and the tame hunter's song, &amp;c. &amp;c., in all which
      my young friends were quite at home. Luckily for me, all this horning and
      hooping drew on some allusion to the Seventh Hussars, which gallant
      regiment, I observe, is a more favourite theme with both Miss Catherine
      and her brother than with my old friend, who presently looked at his
      watch, and said something significantly to Mr. James about office hours.
      The youth got up with the ease of a youngster that would be thought a man
      of fashion rather than of business, and endeavoured, with some success, to
      walk out of the room, as if the locomotion was entirely voluntary; Miss
      Catherine and her sisters left us at the same time, and now, thought I, my
      trial comes on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reader, did you ever, in the course of your life, cheat the courts of
      justice and lawyers, by agreeing to refer a dubious and important question
      to the decision of a mutual friend? If so, you may have remarked the
      relative change which the arbiter undergoes in your estimation, when
      raised, though by your own free choice, from an ordinary acquaintance,
      whose opinions were of as little consequence to you as yours to him, into
      a superior personage, on whose decision your fate must depend <i>pro tanto</i>,
      as my friend Mr. Fairscribe would say. His looks assume a mysterious if
      not a minatory expression; his hat has a loftier air, and his wig, if he
      wears one, a more formidable buckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt, accordingly, that my good friend Fairscribe, on the present
      occasion, had acquired something of a similar increase of consequence. But
      a week since, he had, in my opinion, been indeed an excellent-meaning man,
      perfectly competent to every thing within his own profession, but immured,
      at the same time, among its forms and technicalities, and as incapable of
      judging of matters of taste as any mighty Goth whatsoever, of or belonging
      to the ancient Senate-House of Scotland. But what of that? I had made him
      my judge by my own election; and I have often observed, that an idea of
      declining such a reference, on account of his own consciousness of
      incompetency, is, as it perhaps ought to be, the last which occurs to the
      referee himself. He that has a literary work subjected to his judgment by
      the author, immediately throws his mind into a critical attitude, though
      the subject be one which he never before thought of. No doubt the author
      is well qualified to select his own judge, and why should the arbiter whom
      he has chosen doubt his own talents for condemnation or acquittal, since
      he has been doubtless picked out by his friend, from his indubitable
      reliance on their competence? Surely, the man who wrote the production is
      likely to know the person best qualified to judge of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst these thoughts crossed my brain, I kept my eyes fixed on my good
      friend, whose motions appeared unusually tardy to me, while he ordered a
      bottle of particular claret, decanted it with scrupulous accuracy with his
      own hand, caused his old domestic to bring a saucer of olives, and chips
      of toasted bread, and thus, on hospitable thoughts intent, seemed to me to
      adjourn the discussion which I longed to bring on, yet feared to
      precipitate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dissatisfied,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;and is ashamed to show it, afraid
      doubtless of hurting my feelings. What had I to do to talk to him about
      any thing save charters and sasines?&mdash;Stay, he is going to begin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are old fellows now, Mr. Croftangry,&rdquo; said my landlord; &ldquo;scarcely so
      fit to take a poor quart of claret between us, as we would have been in
      better days to take a pint, in the old Scottish liberal acceptation of the
      phrase. Maybe you would have liked me to have kept James to help us. But
      if it is not a holyday or so, I think it is best he should observe office
      hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the discourse was about to fall. I relieved it by saying, Mr. James
      was at the happy time of life, when he had better things to do than to sit
      over the bottle. &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;your son is a reader.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um&mdash;yes&mdash;James may be called a reader in a sense; but I doubt
      there is little solid in his studies&mdash;poetry and plays, Mr.
      Croftangry, all nonsense&mdash;they set his head a-gadding after the army,
      when he should be minding his business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose, then, that romances do not find much more grace in your eyes
      than dramatic and poetical compositions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deil a bit, deil a bit, Mr. Croftangry, nor historical productions
      either. There is too much fighting in history, as if men only were brought
      into this world to send one another out of it. It nourishes false notions
      of our being, and chief and proper end, Mr. Croftangry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still all this was general, and I became determined to bring our discourse
      to a focus. &ldquo;I am afraid, then, I have done very ill to trouble you with
      my idle manuscripts, Mr. Fairscribe; but you must do me the justice to
      remember, that I had nothing better to do than to amuse myself by writing
      the sheets I put into your hands the other day. I may truly plead&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'I left no calling for this idle trade.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cry your mercy, Mr. Croftangry,&rdquo; said my old friend, suddenly
      recollecting&mdash;&ldquo;yes, yes, I have been very rude; but I had forgotten
      entirely that you had taken a spell yourself at that idle man's trade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;you, on your side, have been too <i>busy</i> a
      man to look at my poor Chronicles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said my friend, &ldquo;I am not so bad as that neither. I have read
      them bit by bit, just as I could get a moment's time, and I believe, I
      shall very soon get through them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my good friend?&rdquo; said I, interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      And &ldquo;<i>Well</i>, Mr. Croftangry,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;I really think you have got
      over the ground very tolerably well. I have noted down here two or three
      bits of things, which I presume to be errors of the press, otherwise it
      might be alleged, perhaps, that you did not fully pay that attention to
      the grammatical rules, which one would desire to see rigidly observed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at my friend's notes, which, in fact, showed, that in one or two
      grossly obvious passages, I had left uncorrected such solecisms in
      grammar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, I own my fault; but, setting apart these casual errors, how
      do you like the matter and the manner of what I have been writing, Mr.
      Fairscribe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said my friend, pausing, with more grave and important hesitation
      than I thanked him for, &ldquo;there is not much to be said against the manner.
      The style is terse and intelligible, Mr. Croftangry, very intelligible;
      and that I consider as the first point in every thing that is intended to
      be understood. There are, indeed, here and there some flights and fancies,
      which I comprehended with difficulty; but I got to your meaning at last.
      There are people that are like ponies; their judgments cannot go fast, but
      they go sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a pretty clear proposition, my friend; but then how did you like
      the meaning when you did get at it? or was that like some ponies, too
      difficult to catch, and, when caught, not worth the trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am far from saying that, my dear sir, in respect it would be downright
      uncivil; but since you ask my opinion, I wish you could have thought about
      something more appertaining to civil policy, than all this bloody work
      about shooting and dirking, and downright hanging. I am told it was the
      Germans who first brought in such a practice of choosing their heroes out
      of the Porteous Roll; [Footnote: List of criminal indictments, so termed
      in Scotland.] but, by my faith, we are like to be upsides with them. The
      first was, as I am credibly informed, Mr. Scolar, as they call him; a
      scholar-like piece of work he has made of it, with his robbers and
      thieves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Schiller,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;my dear sir, let it be Schiller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Schiller, or what you like,&rdquo; said Mr. Fairscribe; &ldquo;I found the book where
      I wish I had found a better one, and that is, in Kate's work-basket. I sat
      down, and, like an old fool, began to read; but there, I grant, you have
      the better of Schiller, Mr. Croftangry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be glad, my dear sir, that you really think I have <i>approached</i>
      that admirable author; even your friendly partiality ought not to talk of
      my having <i>excelled</i> him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do say you have excelled him, Mr. Croftangry, in a most material
      particular. For surely a book of amusement should be something that one
      can take up and lay down at pleasure; and I can say justly, I was never at
      the least loss to put aside these sheets of yours when business came in
      the way. But, faith, this Schiller, sir, does not let you off so easily. I
      forgot one appointment on particular business, and I wilfully broke
      through another, that I might stay at home and finish his confounded book,
      which, after all, is about two brothers, the greatest rascals I ever heard
      of. The one, sir, goes near to murder his own father, and the other (which
      you would think still stranger) sets about to debauch his own wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find, then, Mr. Fairscribe, that you have no taste for the romance of
      real life&mdash;no pleasure in contemplating those spirit-rousing
      impulses, which force men of fiery passions upon great crimes and great
      virtues?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, as to that, I am not just so sure. But then to mend the matter,&rdquo;
       continued the critic, &ldquo;you have brought in Highlanders into every story,
      as if you were going back again, <i>velis et remis</i>, into the old days
      of Jacobitism. I must speak my plain mind, Mr. Croftangry. I cannot tell
      what innovations in Kirk and State may now be proposed, but our fathers
      were friends to both, as they were settled at the glorious Revolution, and
      liked a tartan plaid as little as they did a white surplice. I wish to
      Heaven, all this tartan fever bode well to the Protestant succession and
      the Kirk of Scotland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both too well settled, I hope, in the minds of the subject,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to
      be affected by old remembrances, on which we look back as on the portraits
      of our ancestors, without recollecting, while we gaze on them, any of the
      feuds by which the originals were animated while alive. But most happy
      should I be to light upon any topic to supply the place of the Highlands,
      Mr. Fairscribe. I have been just reflecting that the theme is becoming a
      little exhausted, and your experience may perhaps supply&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha, ha!&mdash;<i>my</i> experience supply!&rdquo; interrupted Mr.
      Fairscribe, with a laugh of derision;&mdash;&ldquo;why, you might as well ask my
      son James's experience to supply a case&rdquo; about thirlage. No, no, my good
      friend, I have lived by the law, and in the law, all my life; and when you
      seek the impulses that make soldiers desert and shoot their sergeants and
      corporals, and Highland drovers dirk English graziers, to prove themselves
      men of fiery passions, it is not to a man like me you should come. I could
      tell you some tricks of my own trade, perhaps, and a queer story or two of
      estates that have been lost and recovered. But, to tell you the truth, I
      think you might do with your Muse of Fiction, as you call her, as many an
      honest man does with his own sons in flesh and blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how is that, my dear sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send her to India, to be sure. That is the true place for a Scot to
      thrive in; and if you carry your story fifty years back, as there is
      nothing to hinder you, you will find as much shooting and stabbing there
      as ever was in the wild Highlands. If you want rogues, as they are so much
      in fashion with you, you have that gallant caste of adventurers, who laid
      down their consciences at the Cape of Good Hope as they went out to India,
      and forgot to take them up again when they returned. Then, for great
      exploits, you have in the old history of India, before Europeans were
      numerous there, the most wonderful deeds, done by the least possible
      means, that perhaps the annals of the world can afford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said I, kindling at the ideas his speech inspired. &ldquo;I
      remember in the delightful pages of Orme, the interest which mingles in
      his narratives, from the very small number of English which are engaged.
      Each officer of a regiment becomes known to you by name, nay, the
      non-commissioned officers and privates acquire an individual share of
      interest. They are distinguished among the natives like the Spaniards
      among the Mexicans. What do I say? They are like Homer's demigods among
      the warring mortals. Men, like Clive and Caillaud, influenced great
      events, like Jove himself. Inferior officers are like Mars or Neptune; and
      the sergeants and corporals might well pass for demigods. Then the various
      religious costumes, habits, and manners of the people of Hindustan,&mdash;the
      patient Hindhu, the warlike Rajahpoot, the haughty Moslemah, the savage
      and vindictive Malay&mdash;Glorious and unbounded subjects! The only
      objection is, that I have never been there, and know nothing at all about
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, my good friend. You will tell us about them all the better that
      you know nothing of what you are saying; and come, we'll finish the
      bottle, and when Katie (her sisters go to the assembly) has given us tea,
      she will tell you the outline of the story of poor Menie Gray, whose
      picture you will see in the drawing-room, a distant relation of my
      father's, who had, however, a handsome part of cousin Menie's succession.
      There are none living that can be hurt by the story now, though it was
      thought best to smother it up at the time, as indeed even the whispers
      about it led poor cousin Menie to live very retired. I mind her well when
      a child. There was something very gentle, but rather tiresome, about poor
      cousin Menie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we came into the drawing-room, my friend pointed to a picture which I
      had before noticed, without, however, its having attracted more than a
      passing look; now I regarded it with more attention. It was one of those
      portraits of the middle of the eighteenth century, in which artists
      endeavoured to conquer the stiffness of hoops and brocades; by throwing a
      fancy drapery around the figure, with loose folds like a mantle or
      dressing gown, the stays, however, being retained, and the bosom displayed
      in a manner which shows that our mothers, like their daughters, were as
      liberal of their charms as the nature of the dress might permit. To this,
      the well-known style of the period, the features and form of the
      individual added, at first sight, little interest. It represented a
      handsome woman of about thirty, her hair wound simply about her head, her
      features regular, and her complexion fair. But on looking more closely,
      especially after having had a hint that the original had been the heroine
      of a tale, I could observe a melancholy sweetness in the countenance that
      seemed to speak of woes endured, and injuries sustained, with that
      resignation which women can and do sometimes display under the insults and
      ingratitude of those on whom they have bestowed their affections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she was an excellent and an ill-used woman,&rdquo; said Mr. Fairscribe,
      his eye fixed like mine on the picture&mdash;&ldquo;She left our family not
      less, I dare say, than five thousand pounds, and I believe she died worth
      four times that sum; but it was divided among the nearest of kin, which
      was all fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But her history, Mr. Fairscribe,&rdquo; said I&mdash;&ldquo;to judge from her look,
      it must have been a melancholy one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may say that, Mr. Croftangry. Melancholy enough, and extraordinary
      enough too&mdash;But,&rdquo; added he, swallowing in haste a cup of the tea
      which was presented to him, &ldquo;I must away to my business&mdash;we cannot be
      gowfling all the morning, and telling old stories all the afternoon. Katie
      knows all the outs and the ins of cousin Menie's adventures as well as I
      do, and when she has given you the particulars, then I am at your service,
      to condescend more articulately upon dates or particulars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, here was I, a gay old bachelor, left to hear a love tale from my
      young friend Katie Fairscribe, who, when she is not surrounded by a bevy
      of gallants, at which time, to my thinking, she shows less to advantage,
      is as pretty, well-behaved, and unaffected a girl as you see tripping the
      new walks of Prince's Street or Heriot Row. Old bachelorship so decided as
      mine has its privileges in such a <i>tete-a-tete</i>, providing you are,
      or can seem for the time, perfectly good-humoured and attentive, and do
      not ape the manners of your younger years, in attempting which you will
      only make yourself ridiculous. I don't pretend to be so indifferent to the
      company of a pretty young woman as was desired by the poet, who wished to
      sit beside his mistress&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &mdash;&ldquo;As unconcern'd as when
    Her infant beauty could beget
  Nor happiness nor pain.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      On the contrary, I can look on beauty and innocence, as something of which
      I know and esteem the value, without the desire or hope to make them my
      own. A young lady can afford to talk with an old stager like me without
      either artifice or affectation; and we may maintain a species of
      friendship, the more tender, perhaps, because we are of different sexes,
      yet with which that distinction has very little to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I hear my wisest and most critical neighbour remark, &ldquo;Mr. Croftangry
      is in the way of doing a foolish thing, He is well to pass&mdash;Old
      Fairscribe knows to a penny what he is worth, and Miss Katie, with all her
      airs, may like the old brass that buys the new pan. I thought Mr.
      Croftangry was looking very cadgy when he came in to play a rubber with us
      last night. Poor gentleman, I am sure I should be sorry to see him make a
      fool of himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Spare your compassion, dear madam, there is not the least danger. The <i>beaux
      yeux de ma casette</i> are not brilliant enough to make amends for the
      spectacles which must supply the dimness of my own. I am a little deaf,
      too, as you know to your sorrow when we are partners; and if I could get a
      nymph to marry me with all these imperfections, who the deuce would marry
      Janet McEvoy? and from Janet McEvoy Chrystal Croftangry will not part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Katie Fairscribe gave me the tale of Menie Gray with much taste and
      simplicity, not attempting to suppress the feelings, whether of grief or
      resentment, which justly and naturally arose from the circumstances of the
      tale. Her father afterwards confirmed the principal outlines of the story,
      and furnished me with some additional circumstances, which Miss Katie had
      suppressed or forgotten. Indeed, I have learned on this occasion, what old
      Lintot meant when he told Pope, that he used to propitiate the critics of
      importance, when he had a work in the press, by now and then letting them
      see a sheet of the blotted proof, or a few leaves of the original
      manuscript. Our mystery of authorship has something about it so
      fascinating, that if you admit any one, however little he may previously
      have been disposed to such studies, into your confidence, you will find
      that he considers himself as a party interested, and, if success follows,
      will think himself entitled to no inconsiderable share of the praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader has seen that no one could have been naturally less interested
      than was my excellent friend Fairscribe in my lucubrations, when I first
      consulted him on the subject; but since he has contributed a subject to
      the work, he has become a most zealous coadjutor; and half-ashamed, I
      believe, yet half-proud of the literary stock-company, in which he has got
      a share, he never meets me without jogging my elbow, and dropping some
      mysterious hints, as, &ldquo;I am saying&mdash;when will you give us any more of
      yon?&rdquo;&mdash;or, &ldquo;Yon's not a bad narrative&mdash;I like yon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pray Heaven the reader may be of his opinion.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  When fainting Nature call'd for aid,
    And hovering Death prepared the blow,
  His vigorous remedy display'd
    The power of art without the show;
  In Misery's darkest caverns known,
    His useful care was ever nigh,
  Where hopeless Anguish pour'd his groan,
    And lonely Want retired to die;
  No summons mock'd by cold delay,
    No petty gains disclaim'd by pride,

    <p>
      The exquisitely beautiful portrait which the Rambler has painted of his
      friend Levett, well describes Gideon Gray, and many other village doctors,
      from whom Scotland reaps more benefit, and to whom she is perhaps more
      ungrateful than to any other class of men, excepting her schoolmasters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a rural man of medicine is usually the inhabitant of some pretty
      borough or village, which forms the central point of his practice. But,
      besides attending to such cases as the village may afford, he is day and
      night at the service of every one who may command his assistance within a
      circle of forty miles in diameter, untraversed by roads in many
      directions, and including moors, mountains, rivers, and lakes. For late
      and dangerous journeys through an inaccessible country for services of the
      most essential kind, rendered at the expense, or risk at least, of his own
      health and life, the Scottish village doctor receives at best a very
      moderate recompense, often one which is totally inadequate, and very
      frequently none whatever. He has none of the ample resources proper to the
      brothers of the profession in an English town. The burgesses of a Scottish
      borough are rendered, by their limited means of luxury, inaccessible to
      gout, surfeits, and all the comfortable chronic diseases which are
      attendant on wealth and indolence. Four years, or so, of abstemiousness,
      enable them to stand an election dinner; and there is no hope of broken
      heads among a score or two of quiet electors, who settle the business over
      a table. There the mothers of the state never make a point of pouring, in
      the course of every revolving year, a certain quantity of doctor's stuff
      through the bowels of their beloved children. Every old woman, from the
      Townhead to the Townfit, can prescribe a dose of salts, or spread a
      plaster; and it is only when a fever or a palsy renders matters serious,
      that the assistance of the doctor is invoked by his neighbours in the
      borough.
    </p>
    <p>
      But still the man of science cannot complain of inactivity or want of
      practice. If he does not find patients at his door, he seeks them through
      a wide circle. Like the ghostly lover of Burger's Leonora, he mounts at
      midnight and traverses in darkness, paths which, to those less accustomed
      to them, seem formidable in daylight, through straits where the slightest
      aberration would plunge him into a morass, or throw him over a precipice,
      on to cabins which his horse might ride over without knowing they lay in
      his way, unless he happened to fall through the roofs. When he arrives at
      such a stately termination of his journey, where his services are
      required, either to bring a wretch into the world, or prevent one from
      leaving it, the scene of misery is often such, that, far from touching the
      hard-saved shillings which are gratefully offered to him, he bestows his
      medicines as well as his attendance&mdash;for charity. I have heard the
      celebrated traveller Mungo Park, who had experienced both courses of life,
      rather give the preference to travelling as a discoverer in Africa, than
      to wandering by night and day the wilds of his native land in the capacity
      of a country medical practitioner. He mentioned having once upon a time
      rode forty miles, sat up all night, and successfully assisted a woman
      under influence of the primitive curse, for which his sole remuneration
      was a roasted potato and a draught of buttermilk. But his was not the
      heart which grudged the labour that relieved human misery. In short, there
      is no creature in Scotland that works harder and is more poorly requited
      than the country doctor, unless perhaps it may be his horse. Yet the horse
      is, and indeed must be, hardy, active, and indefatigable, in spite of a
      rough coat and indifferent condition; and so you will often find in his
      master, under an unpromising and blunt exterior, professional skill and
      enthusiasm, intelligence, humanity, courage, and science.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gideon Gray, surgeon in the village of Middlemas, situated in one of
      the midland counties of Scotland, led the rough, active, and ill-rewarded
      course of life which we have endeavoured to describe. He was a man between
      forty and fifty, devoted to his profession, and of such reputation in the
      medical world, that he had been more than once, as opportunities occurred,
      advised to exchange Middlemas and its meagre circle of practice, for some
      of the larger towns in Scotland, or for Edinburgh itself. This advice he
      had always declined. He was a plain blunt man, who did not love restraint,
      and was unwilling to subject himself to that which was exacted in polite
      society. He had not himself found out, nor had any friend hinted to him,
      that a slight touch of the cynic, in manner and habits, gives the
      physician, to the common eye, an air of authority which greatly tends to
      enlarge his reputation. Mr. Gray, or, as the country people called him,
      Doctor Gray, (he might hold the title by diploma for what I know, though
      he only claimed the rank of Master of Arts,) had few wants, and these were
      amply supplied by a professional income which generally approached two
      hundred pounds a year, for which, upon an average, he travelled about five
      thousand miles on horseback in the course of the twelve months. Nay, so
      liberally did this revenue support himself and his ponies, called Pestle
      and Mortar, which he exercised alternately, that he took a damsel to share
      it, Jean Watson, namely, the cherry-cheeked daughter of an honest farmer,
      who being herself one of twelve children who had been brought up on an
      income of fourscore pounds a year, never thought there could be poverty in
      more than double the sum; and looked on Gray, though now termed by
      irreverent youth the Old Doctor, as a very advantageous match. For several
      years they had no children, and it seemed as if Doctor Gray, who had so
      often assisted the efforts of the goddess Lucina, was never to invoke her
      in his own behalf. Yet his domestic roof was, on a remarkable occasion,
      decreed to be the scene where the goddess's art was required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late of an autumn evening three old women might be observed plying their
      aged limbs through the single street of the village at Middlemas towards
      the honoured door, which, fenced off from the vulgar causeway, was
      defended by a broken paling, enclosing two slips of ground, half arable,
      half overrun with an abortive attempt at shrubbery. The door itself was
      blazoned with the name of Gideon Gray, M. A. Surgeon, &amp;c. &amp;c. Some
      of the idle young fellows, who had been a minute or two before loitering
      at the other end of the street before the door of the alehouse, (for the
      pretended inn deserved no better name,) now accompanied the old dames with
      shouts of laughter, excited by their unwonted agility; and with bets on
      the winner, as loudly expressed as if they had been laid at the starting
      post of Middlemas races. &ldquo;Half a mutchkin on Luckie Simson!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Auld
      Peg Tamson against the field!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Mair speed, Alison Jaup, ye'll tak
      the wind out of them yet!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Canny against the hill, lasses, or we
      may have a burstern auld earline amang ye!&rdquo; These, and a thousand such
      gibes, rent the air, without being noticed, or even heard, by the anxious
      racers, whose object of contention seemed to be, which should first reach
      the Doctor's door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guide us, Doctor, what can be the matter now?&rdquo; said Mrs. Gray, whose
      character was that of a good-natured simpleton; &ldquo;Here's Peg Tamson, Jean
      Simson, and Alison Jaup, running a race on the hie street of the burgh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor, who had but the moment before hung his wet great-coat before
      the fire, (for he was just dismounted from a long journey,) hastened down
      stairs, arguing some new occasion for his services, and happy, that, from,
      the character of the messengers, it was likely to be within burgh, and not
      landward.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had just reached the door as Luckie Simson, one of the racers, arrived
      in the little area before it. She had got the start, and kept it, but at
      the expense, for the time, of her power of utterance; for when she came in
      presence of the Doctor, she stood blowing like a grampus, her loose toy
      flying back from her face, making the most violent effort to speak, but
      without the power of uttering a single intelligible word. Peg Thompson
      whipped in before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The leddy, sir, the leddy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instant help, instant help!&rdquo;&mdash;screeched rather than uttered, Alison
      Jaup; while Luckie Simson, who had certainly won the race, found words to
      claim the prize which had set them all in motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I hope, sir, you will recommend me to be the sick-nurse; I was here
      to bring you the tidings lang before ony o' thae lazy queans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loud were the counter-protestations of the two competitors, and loud the
      laugh of the idle <i>loons</i> who listened at a little distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue, ye flyting fools,&rdquo; said the Doctor; &ldquo;and you, ye idle
      rascals, if I come out among you.&rdquo; So saying, he smacked his long-lashed
      whip with great emphasis, producing much the effect of the celebrated <i>Quos
      ego</i> of Neptune in the first AEneid.&mdash;&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the Doctor,
      &ldquo;where, or who, is this lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question was scarce necessary; for a plain carriage, with four horses,
      came at a foot's pace towards the door of the Doctor's house, and the old
      women, now more at their ease, gave the Doctor to understand, that the
      gentleman thought the accommodation of the Swan Inn totally unfit for his
      lady's rank and condition, and had, by their advice, (each claiming the
      merit of the suggestion,) brought her here, to experience the hospitality
      of the <i>west room;</i>&mdash;a spare apartment, in which Doctor Gray
      occasionally accommodated such patients, as he desired to keep for a space
      of time under his own eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two persons only in the vehicle. The one, a gentleman in a
      riding dress, sprung out, and having received from the Doctor an assurance
      that the lady would receive tolerable accommodation in his house, he lent
      assistance to his companion to leave the carriage, and with great apparent
      satisfaction, saw her safely deposited in a decent sleeping apartment, and
      under the respectable charge of the Doctor and his lady, who assured him
      once more of every species of attention. To bind their promise more
      firmly, the stranger slipped a purse of twenty guineas (for this story
      chanced in the golden age) into the hand of the Doctor, as an earnest of
      the most liberal recompense, and requested he would spare no expense in
      providing all that was necessary or desirable for a person in the lady's
      condition, and for the helpless being to whom she might immediately be
      expected to give birth. He then said he would retire to the inn, where he
      begged a message might instantly acquaint him with the expected change in
      the lady's situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is of rank,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and a foreigner; let no expense be spared. We
      designed to have reached Edinburgh, but were forced to turn off the road
      by an accident.&rdquo; Once more he said, &ldquo;Let no expense be spared, and manage
      that she may travel as soon as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the Doctor, &ldquo;is past my control. Nature must not be hurried,
      and she avenges herself of every attempt to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But art,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;can do much,&rdquo; and he proffered a second
      purse, which seemed as heavy as the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Art,&rdquo; said the Doctor, &ldquo;may be recompensed, but cannot be purchased. You
      have already paid me more than enough to take the utmost care I can of
      your lady; should I accept more money, it could only be for promising, by
      implication at least, what is beyond my power to perform. Every possible
      care shall be taken of your lady, and that affords the best chance of her
      being speedily able to travel. Now, go you to the inn, sir, for I may be
      instantly wanted, and we have not yet provided either an attendant for the
      lady, or a nurse for the child; but both shall be presently done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet a moment, Doctor&mdash;what languages do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Latin and French I can speak indifferently, and so as to be understood;
      and I read a little Italian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But no Portuguese or Spanish?&rdquo; continued the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is unlucky. But you may make her understand you by means of French.
      Take notice, you are to comply with her request in everything&mdash;if you
      want means to do so, you may apply to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask, sir, by what name the lady is to be&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is totally indifferent,&rdquo; said the stranger, interrupting the question;
      &ldquo;You shall know it at more leisure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he threw his ample cloak about him, turning himself half round
      to assist the operation, with an air which the Doctor would have found it
      difficult to imitate, and walked down the street to the little inn. Here
      he paid and dismissed the postilions, and shut himself up in an apartment,
      ordering no one to be admitted till the Doctor should call.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor, when he returned to his patient's apartment, found his wife in
      great surprise, which, as is usual with persons of her character, was not
      unmixed with fear and anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She cannot speak a word like a Christian being,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said the Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she threeps to keep on a black fause-face, and skirls if we offer to
      take it away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, let her wear it&mdash;What harm will it do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harm, Doctor!&rdquo; Was ever honest woman brought to bed with a fause-face
      on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seldom, perhaps. But, Jean, my dear, those who are not quite honest must
      be brought to bed all the same as those who are, and we are not to
      endanger the poor thing's life by contradicting her whims at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Approaching the sick woman's bed, he observed that she indeed wore a thin
      silk mask, of the kind which do such uncommon service in the elder comedy;
      such as women of rank still wore in travelling, but certainly never in the
      situation of this poor lady. It would seem she had sustained importunity
      on the subject, for when she saw the Doctor, she put her hand to her face,
      as if she was afraid he would insist on pulling off the vizard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hastened to say, in tolerable French, that her will should be a law to
      them in every respect, and that she was at perfect liberty to wear the
      mask till it was her pleasure to lay it aside. She understood him; for she
      replied, by a very imperfect attempt, in the same language, to express her
      gratitude for the permission, as she seemed to regard it, of retaining her
      disguise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor proceeded to other arrangements; and, for the satisfaction of
      those readers who may love minute information, we record, that Luckie
      Simson, the first in the race, carried as a prize the situation of
      sick-nurse beside the delicate patient; that Peg Thomson was permitted the
      privilege of recommending her good-daughter, Bet Jamieson, to be
      wet-nurse; and an <i>oe</i>, or grandchild, of Luckie Jaup was hired to
      assist in the increased drudgery of the family; the Doctor thus, like a
      practised minister, dividing among his trusty adherents such good things
      as fortune placed at his disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      About one in the morning the Doctor made his appearance at the Swan Inn,
      and acquainted the stranger gentleman, that he wished him joy of being the
      father of a healthy boy, and that the mother was, in the usual phrase, as
      well as could be expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger heard the news with seeming satisfaction, and then exclaimed,
      &ldquo;He must be christened, Doctor! he must be christened instantly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can be no hurry for that,&rdquo; said the Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>We</i> think otherwise,&rdquo; said the stranger, cutting his argument
      short. &ldquo;I am a Catholic, Doctor, and as I may be obliged to leave this
      place before the lady is able to travel, I desire to see my child received
      into the pale of the Church. There is, I understand, a Catholic priest in
      this wretched place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a Catholic gentleman, sir, Mr. Goodriche, who is reported to be
      in orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I commend your caution, Doctor,&rdquo; said the stranger; &ldquo;it is dangerous to
      be too positive on any subject. I will bring that same Mr. Goodriche to
      your house to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gray hesitated for a moment. &ldquo;I am a Presbyterian Protestant, sir,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;a friend to the constitution as established in Church and State, as
      I have a good right, having drawn his Majesty's pay, God bless him, for
      four years, as surgeon's mate in the Cameronian regiment, as my regimental
      Bible and commission can testify. But although I be bound especially to
      abhor all trafficking or trinketing with Papists, yet I will not stand in
      the way of a tender conscience. Sir, you may call with Mr. Goodriche, when
      you please, at my house; and undoubtedly, you being, as I suppose, the
      father of the child, you will arrange matters as you please; only, I do
      not desire to be though an abettor or countenancer of any part of the
      Popish ritual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough, sir,&rdquo; said the stranger haughtily, &ldquo;we understand each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day he appeared at the Doctor's house with Mr. Goodriche, and two
      persons understood to belong to that reverend gentleman's communion. The
      party were shut up in an apartment with the infant, and it may be presumed
      that the solemnity of baptism was administered to the unconscious being,
      thus strangely launched upon the world. When the priest and witnesses had
      retired, the strange gentleman informed Mr. Gray, that, as the lady had
      been pronounced unfit for travelling for several days, he was himself
      about to leave the neighbourhood, but would return thither in the space of
      ten days, when he hoped to find his companion able to leave it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by what name are we to call the child and mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The infant's name is Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it must have some sirname&mdash;so must the lady&mdash;She cannot
      reside in my house, yet be without a name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call them by the name of your town here&mdash;Middlemas, I think it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mrs. Middlemas is the name of the mother, and Richard Middlemas of
      the child&mdash;and I am Matthew Middlemas, at your service. This,&rdquo; he
      continued, &ldquo;will provide Mrs. Middlemas in every thing she may wish to
      possess&mdash;or assist her in case of accidents.&rdquo; With that he placed
      L100 in Mr. Gray's hand, who rather scrupled receiving it, saying, &ldquo;He
      supposed the lady was qualified to be her own purse-bearer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worst in the world, I assure you, Doctor,&rdquo; replied the stranger. &ldquo;If
      she wished to change that piece of paper, she would scarce know how many
      guineas she should receive for it. No, Mr. Gray, I assure you you will
      find Mrs. Middleton&mdash;Middlemas&mdash;what did I call her&mdash;as
      ignorant of the affairs of this world as any one you have met with in your
      practice: So you will please to be her treasurer and administrator for the
      time, as for a patient that is incapable to look after her own affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was spoke, as it struck Dr. Gray, in rather a haughty and
      supercilious manner. The words intimated nothing in themselves, more than
      the same desire of preserving incognito, which might be gathered from all
      the rest of the stranger's conduct; but the manner seemed to say, &ldquo;I am
      not a person to be questioned by any one&mdash;what I say must be received
      without comment, how little soever you may believe or understand it.&rdquo; It
      strengthened Gray in his opinion, that he had before him a case either of
      seduction, or of private marriage, betwixt persons of the very highest
      rank; and the whole bearing, both of the lady and the gentleman, confirmed
      his suspicions. It was not in his nature to be troublesome or inquisitive,
      but he could not fail to see that the lady wore no marriage-ring; and her
      deep sorrow, and perpetual tremor, seemed to indicate an unhappy creature,
      who had lost the protection of parents, without acquiring a legitimate
      right to that of a husband. He was therefore somewhat anxious when Mr.
      Middlemas, after a private conference of some length with the lady, bade
      him farewell. It is true, he assured him of his return within ten days,
      being the very shortest space which Gray could be prevailed upon to assign
      for any prospect of the lady being moved with safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust in Heaven that he will return,&rdquo; said Gray to himself, &ldquo;but there
      is too much mystery about all this, for the matter being a plain and
      well-meaning transaction. If he intends to treat this poor thing, as many
      a poor girl has been used before, I hope that my house will not be the
      scene in which he chooses to desert her. The leaving the money has
      somewhat a suspicious aspect, and looks as if my friend were in the act of
      making some compromise with his conscience. Well&mdash;I must hope the
      best. Meantime, my path plainly is to do what I can for the poor lady's
      benefit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gray visited his patient shortly after Mr. Middlemas's departure&mdash;as
      soon, indeed, as he could be admitted. He found her in violent agitation.
      Gray's experience dictated the best mode of relief and tranquillity. He
      caused her infant to be brought to her. She wept over it for a long time,
      and the violence of her agitation subsided under the influence of parental
      feelings, which, from her appearance of extreme youth, she must have
      experienced for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The observant physician could, after this paroxysm, remark that his
      patient's mind was chiefly occupied in computing the passage of the time,
      and anticipating the period when the return of her husband&mdash;if
      husband he was&mdash;might be expected. She consulted almanacks, enquired
      concerning distances, though so cautiously as to make it evident she
      desired to give no indication of the direction of her companion's journey,
      and repeatedly compared, her watch with those of others; exercising, it
      was evident, all that delusive species of mental arithmetic by which
      mortals attempt to accelerate the passage of Time while they calculate his
      progress. At other times she wept anew over her child, which was by all
      judges pronounced as goodly an infant as needed to be seen; and Gray
      sometimes observed that she murmured sentences to the unconscious infant,
      not only the words, but the very sound and accents of which were strange
      to him, and which, in particular, he knew not to be Portuguese.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Goodriche, the Catholic priest, demanded access to her upon one
      occasion. She at first declined his visit, but afterwards received it,
      under the idea, perhaps, that he might have news from Mr. Middlemas, as he
      called himself. The interview was a very short one, and the priest left
      the lady's apartment in displeasure, which his prudence could scarce
      disguise from Mr. Gray. He never returned, although the lady's condition
      would have made his attentions and consolations necessary, had she been a
      member of the Catholic Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Doctor began at length to suspect his fair guest was a Jewess, who had
      yielded up her person and affections to one of a different religion; and
      the peculiar style of her beautiful countenance went to enforce this
      opinion. The circumstance made no difference to Gray, who saw only her
      distress and desolation, and endeavoured to remedy both to the utmost of
      his power. He was, however, desirous to conceal it from his wife, and the
      others around the sick person, whose prudence and liberality of thinking
      might be more justly doubted. He therefore so regulated her diet, that she
      could not be either offended, or brought under suspicion, by any of the
      articles forbidden by the Mosaic law being presented to her. In other
      respects than what concerned her health or convenience, he had but little
      intercourse with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The space passed within which the stranger's return to the borough had
      been so anxiously expected by his female companion. The disappointment
      occasioned by his non-arrival was manifested in the convalescent by
      inquietude, which was at first mingled with peevishness, and afterwards
      with doubt and fear. When two or three days had passed without message or
      letter of any kind, Gray himself became anxious, both on his own account
      and the poor lady's, lest the stranger should have actually entertained
      the idea of deserting this defenceless and probably injured woman. He
      longed to have some communication with her, which might enable him to
      judge what enquiries could be made, or what else was most fitting to be
      done. But so imperfect was the poor young woman's knowledge of the French
      language, and perhaps so unwilling she herself to throw any light on her
      situation, that every attempt of this kind proved abortive. When Gray
      asked questions concerning any subject which appeared to approach to
      explanation, he observed she usually answered him by shaking her head, in
      token of not understanding what he said; at other times by silence and
      with tears, and sometimes referring him to <i>Monsieur</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For <i>Monsieur's</i> arrival, then, Gray began to become very impatient,
      as that which alone could put an end to a disagreeable species of mystery,
      which the good company of the borough began now to make the principal
      subject of their gossip; some blaming Gray for taking foreign <i>landloupers</i>
      [Footnote: Strollers.] into his house, on the subject of whose morals the
      most serious doubts might be entertained; others envying the &ldquo;bonny hand&rdquo;
       the doctor was like to make of it, by having disposal of the wealthy
      stranger's travelling funds; a circumstance which could not be well
      concealed from the public, when the honest man's expenditure for trifling
      articles of luxury came far to exceed its ordinary bounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conscious probity of the honest Doctor enabled him to despise this
      sort of tittle-tattle, though the secret knowledge of its existence could
      not be agreeable to him. He went his usual rounds with his usual
      perseverance, and waited with patience until time should throw light on
      the subject and history of his lodger. It was now the fourth week after
      her confinement, and the recovery of the stranger might be considered as
      perfect, when Gray, returning from one of his ten-mile visits, saw a
      post-chaise and four horses at the door. &ldquo;This man has returned,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;and my suspicions have done him less than justice.&rdquo; With that he spurred
      his horse, a signal which the trusty steed obeyed the more readily, as its
      progress was in the direction of the stable door. But when, dismounting,
      the Doctor hurried into his own house, it seemed to him, that the
      departure as well as the arrival of this distressed lady was destined to
      bring confusion to his peaceful dwelling. Several idlers had assembled
      about his door, and two or three had impudently thrust themselves forward
      almost into the passage, to listen to a confused altercation which was
      heard from within.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor hastened forward, the foremost of the intruders retreating in
      confusion on his approach, while he caught the tones of his wife's voice,
      raised to a pitch which he knew, by experience, boded no good; for Mrs.
      Gray, good-humoured and tractable in general, could sometimes perform the
      high part in a matrimonial duet. Having much more confidence in his wife's
      good intentions than her prudence, he lost no time in pushing into the
      parlour, to take the matter into his own hands. Here he found his helpmate
      at the head of the whole militia of the sick lady's apartment, that is,
      wet nurse, and sick nurse, and girl of all work, engaged in violent
      dispute with two strangers. The one was a dark-featured elderly man, with
      an eye of much sharpness and severity of expression, which now seemed
      partly quenched by a mixture of grief and mortification. The other, who
      appeared actively sustaining the dispute with Mrs. Gray, was a stout,
      bold-looking, hard-faced person, armed with pistols, of which he made
      rather an unnecessary and ostentatious display.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is my husband, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gray, in a tone of triumph, for she
      had the grace to believe the Doctor one of the greatest men living,&mdash;&ldquo;Here
      is the Doctor&mdash;let us see what you will say now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why just what I said before, ma'am,&rdquo; answered the man, &ldquo;which is, that my
      warrant must be obeyed. It is regular, ma'am, regular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he struck the forefinger of his right hand against a paper
      which he held towards Mrs. Gray with his left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Address yourself to me, if you please, sir,&rdquo; said the Doctor, seeing that
      he ought to lose no time in removing the cause into the proper court. &ldquo;I
      am the master of this house, sir, and I wish to know the cause of this
      visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My business is soon told,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;I am a king's messenger, and
      this lady has treated me as if I was a baron-bailie's officer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not the question, sir,&rdquo; replied the Doctor. &ldquo;If you are a king's
      messenger, where is your warrant, and what do you propose to do here?&rdquo; At
      the same time he whispered the little wench to call Mr. Lawford, the
      town-clerk, to come thither as fast as he possibly could. The
      good-daughter of Peg Thomson started off with an activity worthy of her
      mother-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is my warrant,&rdquo; said the official, &ldquo;and you may satisfy yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The shameless loon dare not tell the Doctor his errand,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gray
      exultingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bonny errand it is,&rdquo; said old Lucky Simson, &ldquo;to carry away a lying-in
      woman as a gled [Footnote: Or Kite.] would do a clocking-hen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman no a month delivered&rdquo;&mdash;echoed the nurse Jamieson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-four days eight hours and seven minutes to a second,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor having looked over the warrant, which was regular, began to be
      afraid that the females of his family, in their zeal for defending the
      character of their sex, might be stirred up into some sudden fit of
      mutiny, and therefore commanded them to be silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is a warrant for arresting the bodies of Richard
      Tresham, and of Zilia de Moncada on account of high treason. Sir, I have
      served his Majesty, and this is not a house in which traitors are
      harboured. I know nothing of any of these two persons, nor have I ever
      heard even their names.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the lady whom you have received into your family,&rdquo; said the
      messenger, &ldquo;is Zilia de Moncada, and here stands her father, Matthias de
      Moncada, who will make oath to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this be true,&rdquo; said Mr. Gray, looking towards the alleged officer,
      &ldquo;you have taken a singular duty on you. It is neither my habit to deny my
      own actions, nor to oppose the laws of the land. There is a lady in this
      house slowly recovering from confinement, having become under this roof
      the mother of a healthy child. If she be the person described in this
      warrant, and this gentleman's daughter, I must surrender her to the laws
      of the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the Esculapian militia were once more in motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surrender, Dr. Gray! It's a shame to hear you speak, and you that lives
      by women and weans, abune your other means!&rdquo; so exclaimed his fair better
      part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder to hear the Doctor!&rdquo; said the younger nurse; &ldquo;there's no a wife
      in the town would believe it o' him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I aye thought the Doctor was a man till this moment,&rdquo; said Luckie Simson;
      &ldquo;but I believe him now to be an auld wife, little baulder than mysell; and
      I dinna wonder that poor Mrs. Gray&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your peace, you foolish woman,&rdquo; said the Doctor. &ldquo;Do you think this
      business is not bad enough already, that you are making it worse with your
      senseless claver? [Footnote: Tattling.]&mdash;Gentlemen, this is a very
      sad case. Here is a warrant for a high crime against a poor creature, who
      is little fit to be removed from one house to another, much more dragged
      to a prison. I tell you plainly, that I think the execution of this arrest
      may cause her death. It is your business, sir, if you be really her
      father, to consider what you can do to soften this matter, rather than
      drive it on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better death than dishonour,&rdquo; replied the stern-looking old man, with a
      voice as harsh as his aspect; &ldquo;and you, messenger,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;look
      what you do, and execute the warrant at your peril.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear,&rdquo; said the man, appealing to the Doctor himself, &ldquo;I must have
      immediate access to the lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a lucky time,&rdquo; said Mr. Gray, &ldquo;here comes the town-clerk.&mdash;You
      are very welcome, Mr. Lawford. Your opinion here is much wanted as a man
      of law, as well as of sense and humanity. I was never more glad to see you
      in all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then rapidly stated the case; and the messenger, understanding the
      new-comer to be a man of some authority, again exhibited his warrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a very sufficient and valid warrant, Dr. Gray,&rdquo; replied the man
      of law. &ldquo;Nevertheless, if you are disposed to make oath, that instant
      removal would be unfavourable to the lady's health, unquestionably she
      must remain here, suitably guarded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not so much the mere act of locomotion which I am afraid of,&rdquo; said
      the surgeon; &ldquo;but I am free to depone, on soul and conscience, that the
      shame and fear of her father's anger, and the sense of the affront of such
      an arrest, with terror for its consequences, may occasion violent and
      dangerous illness&mdash;even death itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The father must see the daughter, though they may have quarrelled,&rdquo; said
      Mr. Lawford; &ldquo;the officer of justice must execute his warrant though it
      should frighten the criminal to death; these evils are only contingent,
      not direct and immediate consequences. You must give up the lady, Mr.
      Gray, though your hesitation is very natural.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, Mr. Lawford, I ought to be certain that the person in my house
      is the party they search for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admit me to her apartment,&rdquo; replied the man whom the messenger termed
      Moncada.
    </p>
    <p>
      The messenger, whom the presence of Lawford had made something more
      placid, began to become impudent once more. He hoped, he said, by means of
      his female prisoner, to acquire the information necessary to apprehend the
      more guilty person. If more delays were thrown in his way, that
      information might come too late, and he would make all who were accessary
      to such delay responsible for the consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Mr. Gray, &ldquo;though I were to be brought to the gallows for
      it, protest, that this course may be the murder of my patient.&mdash;Can
      bail not be taken, Mr. Lawford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in cases of high treason,&rdquo; said the official person; and then
      continued in a confidential tone, &ldquo;Come, Mr. Gray, we all know you to be a
      person well affected to our Royal Sovereign King George and the
      Government; but you must not push this too far, lest you bring yourself
      into trouble, which every body in Middlemas would be sorry for. The
      forty-five has not been so far gone by, but we can remember enough of
      warrants of high treason&mdash;ay, and ladies of quality committed upon
      such charges. But they were all favourably dealt with&mdash;Lady Ogilvy,
      Lady Macintosh, Flora Macdonald, and all. No doubt this gentleman knows
      what he is doing, and has assurances of the young lady's safety&mdash;So
      you must jouk and let the jaw gae by, as we say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow me, then, gentleman,&rdquo; said Gideon, &ldquo;and you shall see the young
      lady;&rdquo; and then, his strong features working with emotion at anticipation
      of the distress which he was about to inflict, he led the way up the small
      staircase, and opening the door, said to Moncada, who had followed him,
      &ldquo;This is your daughter's only place of refuge, in which I am, alas! too
      weak to be her protector. Enter, sir, if your conscience will permit you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger turned on him a scowl, into which it seemed as if he would
      willingly have thrown the power of the fabled basilisk. Then stepping
      proudly forward, he stalked into the room. He was followed by Lawford and
      Gray at a little distance. The messenger remained in the doorway. The
      unhappy young woman had heard the disturbance, and guessed the cause too
      truly. It is possible she might even have seen the strangers on their
      descent from the carriage. When they entered the room, she was on her
      knees, beside an easy chair, her face in a silk wrapper that was hung over
      it. The man called Moncada uttered a single word; by the accent it might
      have been something equivalent to <i>wretch;</i> but none knew its import.
      The female gave a convulsive shudder, such as that by which a half-dying
      soldier is affected on receiving a second wound. But, without minding her
      emotion, Moncada seized her by the arm, and with little gentleness raised
      her to her feet, on which she seemed to stand only because she was
      supported by his strong grasp. He then pulled from her face the mask which
      she had hitherto worn. The poor creature still endeavoured to shroud her
      face, by covering it with her left hand, as the manner in which she was
      held prevented her from using the aid of the right. With little effort her
      father secured that hand also, which indeed was of itself far too little
      to serve the purpose of concealment, and showed her beautiful face,
      burning with blushes and covered with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, Alcalde, and you, Surgeon,&rdquo; he said to Lawford and Gray, with a
      foreign action and accent, &ldquo;this woman is my daughter, the same Zilia
      Moncada who is signal'd in that protocol. Make way, and let me carry her
      where her crimes may be atoned for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you that person's daughter?&rdquo; said Lawford to the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She understands no English,&rdquo; said Gray; and addressing his patient in
      French, conjured her to let him know whether she was that man's daughter
      or not, assuring her of protection if the fact were otherwise. The answer
      was murmured faintly, but was too distinctly intelligible&mdash;&ldquo;He was
      her father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All farther title of interference seemed now ended. The messenger arrested
      his prisoner, and, with some delicacy, required the assistance of the
      females to get her conveyed to the carriage in waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gray again interfered.&mdash;&ldquo;You will not,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;separate the mother
      and the infant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zilia de Moncada heard the question, (which, being addressed to the
      father, Gray had inconsiderately uttered in French,) and it seemed as if
      it recalled to her recollection the existence of the helpless creature to
      which she had given birth, forgotten for a moment amongst the accumulated
      horrors of her father's presence. She uttered a shriek, expressing
      poignant grief, and turned her eyes on her father with the most intense
      supplication.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the parish with the bastard!&rdquo;&mdash;said Moncada; while the helpless
      mother sunk lifeless into the arms of the females, who had now gathered
      round her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will not pass, sir,&rdquo; said Gideon.&mdash;&ldquo;If you are father to that
      lady, you must be grandfather to the helpless child; and you must settle
      in some manner for its future provision, or refer us to some responsible
      person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moncada looked towards Lawford, who expressed himself satisfied of the
      propriety of what Gray said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I object not to pay for whatever the wretched child may require,&rdquo; said
      he; &ldquo;and if you, sir,&rdquo; addressing Gray, &ldquo;choose to take charge of him, and
      breed him up, you shall have what will better your living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor was about to refuse a charge so uncivilly offered; but after a
      moment's reflection, he replied, &ldquo;I think so indifferently of the
      proceedings I have witnessed, and of those concerned in them, that if the
      mother desires that I should retain the charge of this child, I will not
      refuse to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moncada spoke to his daughter, who was just beginning to recover from her
      swoon, in the same language in which he had at first addressed her. The
      proposition which he made seemed highly acceptable, as she started from
      the arms of the females, and, advancing to Gray, seized his hand, kissed
      it, bathed it in her tears, and seemed reconciled, even in parting with
      her child, by the consideration, that the infant was to remain under his
      guardianship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, kind man,&rdquo; she said in her indifferent French, &ldquo;you have saved both
      mother and child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The father, meanwhile, with mercantile deliberation, placed in Mr.
      Lawford's hands notes and bills to the amount of a thousand pounds, which
      he stated was to be vested for the child's use, and advanced in such
      portions as his board and education might require. In the event of any
      correspondence on his account being necessary, as in case of death or the
      like, he directed that communication should be made to Signor Matthias
      Moncada, under cover to a certain banking house in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But beware,&rdquo; he said to Gray, &ldquo;how you trouble me about these concerns,
      unless in case of absolute necessity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not fear, sir,&rdquo; replied Gray; &ldquo;I have seen nothing to-day which
      can induce me to desire a more intimate correspondence with you than may
      be indispensable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Lawford drew up a proper minute of this transaction, by which he
      himself and Gray were named trustees for the child, Mr. Gray attempted to
      restore to the lady the balance of the considerable sum of money which
      Tresham (if such was his real name) had formally deposited with him. With
      every species of gesture, by which hands, eyes, and even feet, could
      express rejection, as well as in her own broken French, she repelled the
      reimbursement, while she entreated that Gray would consider the money as
      his own property; and at the same time forced upon him a ring set with
      brilliants, which seemed of considerable value. The father then spoke to
      her a few stern words, which she heard with an air of mingled agony and
      submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have given her a few minutes to see and weep over the miserable being
      which has been the seal of her dishonour,&rdquo; said the stern father. &ldquo;Let us
      retire and leave her alone.&mdash;You,&rdquo; to the messenger, &ldquo;watch the door
      of the room on the outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gray, Lawford, and Moncada, retired to the parlour accordingly, where they
      waited in silence, each busied with his own reflections, till, within the
      space of half an hour, they received information that the lady was ready
      to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; replied Moncada; &ldquo;I am glad she has yet sense enough left to
      submit to that which needs must be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he ascended the stair, and returned leading down his daughter,
      now again masked and veiled. As she passed Gray, she uttered the words&mdash;&ldquo;My
      child, my child!&rdquo; in a tone of unutterable anguish; then entered the
      carriage, which was drawn up as close to the door of the doctor's house as
      the little enclosure would permit. The messenger, mounted on a led horse,
      and accompanied by a servant and assistant, followed the carriage, which
      drove rapidly off, taking the road which leads to Edinburgh. All who had
      witnessed this strange scene, now departed to make their conjectures, and
      some to count their gains; for money had been distributed among the
      females who had attended on the lady, with so much liberality, as
      considerably to reconcile them to the breach of the rights of womanhood
      inflicted by the precipitate removal of the patient.

      CHAPTER THE SECOND.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The last cloud of dust which the wheels of the carriage had raised was
      dissipated, when dinner, which claims a share of human thoughts even in
      the midst of the most marvellous and affecting incidents, recurred to
      those of Mrs. Gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Doctor, you will stand glowering out of the window till some
      other patient calls for you, and then have to set off without your dinner;&mdash;and
      I hope Mr. Lawford will take pot-luck with us, for it is just his own
      hour; and indeed we had something rather better than ordinary for this
      poor lady&mdash;lamb and spinage, and a veal Florentine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The surgeon started as from a dream, and joined in his wife's hospitable
      request, to which Lawford willingly assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will suppose the meal finished, a bottle of old and generous Antigua
      upon the table, and a modest little punch-bowl, judiciously replenished
      for the accommodation of the Doctor and his guest. Their conversation
      naturally turned on the strange scene which they had witnessed, and the
      Townclerk took considerable merit for his presence of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am thinking, Doctor,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you might have brewed a bitter browst
      to yourself if I had not come in as I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Troth, and it might very well so be,&rdquo; answered Gray; &ldquo;for, to tell you
      the truth, when I saw yonder fellow vapouring with his pistols among the
      woman-folk in my own house, the old Cameronian spirit began to rise in me,
      and little thing would have made me cleek to the poker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoot, hoot! that would never have done. Na, na,&rdquo; said the man of law,
      &ldquo;this was a case where a little prudence was worth all the pistols and
      pokers in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that was just what I thought when I sent to you, Clerk Lawford,&rdquo; said
      the Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wiser man he could not have called on to a difficult case,&rdquo; added Mrs.
      Gray, as she sat with her work at a little distance from the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks t'ye, and here's t'ye, my good neighbour,&rdquo; answered the scribe;
      &ldquo;will you not let me help you to another glass of punch, Mrs. Gray?&rdquo; This
      being declined, he proceeded. &ldquo;I am jalousing that the messenger and his
      warrant were just brought in to prevent any opposition. Ye saw how quietly
      he behaved after I had laid down the law&mdash;I'll never believe the lady
      is in any risk from him. But the father is a dour chield; depend upon it,
      he has bred up the young filly on the curb-rein, and that has made the
      poor thing start off the course. I should not be surprised that he took
      her abroad, and shut her up in a convent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; replied Doctor Gray, &ldquo;if it be true, as I suspect, that both the
      father and daughter are of the Jewish persuasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Jew!&rdquo; said Mrs. Gray; &ldquo;and have I been taking a' this fyke about a Jew?&mdash;I
      thought she seemed to gie a scunner at the eggs and bacon that Nurse
      Simson spoke about to her. But I thought Jews had aye had lang beards, and
      yon man's face is just like one of our ain folk's&mdash;I have seen the
      Doctor with a langer beard himsell, when he has not had leisure to shave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That might have been Mr. Moncada's case,&rdquo; said Lawford, &ldquo;for he seemed to
      have had a hard journey. But the Jews are often very respectable people,
      Mrs. Gray&mdash;they have no territorial property, because the law is
      against them there, but they have a good hank in the money market&mdash;plenty
      of stock in the funds, Mrs. Gray, and, indeed, I think this poor young
      woman is better with her ain father, though he be a Jew and a dour chield
      into the bargain, than she would have been with the loon that wranged her,
      who is, by your account, Dr. Gray, baith a papist and a rebel. The Jews
      are well attached to government; they hate the Pope, the Devil, and the
      Pretender, as much as any honest man among ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot admire either of the gentlemen,&rdquo; said Gideon. &ldquo;But it is but
      fair to say, that I saw Mr. Moncada when he was highly incensed, and to
      all appearance not without reason. Now, this other man Tresham, if that be
      his name, was haughty to me, and I think something careless of the poor
      young woman, just at the time when he owed her most kindness, and me some
      thankfulness. I am, therefore, of your opinion, Clerk Lawford, that the
      Christian is the worse bargain of the two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think of taking care of this wean yourself, Doctor? That is what
      I call the good Samaritan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At cheap cost. Clerk; the child, if it lives, has enough to bring it up
      decently, and set it out in life, and I can teach it an honourable and
      useful profession. It will be rather an amusement than a trouble to me,
      and I want to make some remarks on the childish diseases, which, with
      God's blessing, the child must come through under my charge; and since
      Heaven has sent us no children&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoot, hoot!&rdquo; said the Town-Clerk, &ldquo;you are in ower great hurry now&mdash;you
      have na been sae lang married yet.&mdash;Mrs. Gray, dinna let my daffing
      chase you away&mdash;we will be for a dish of tea believe, for the Doctor
      and I are nae glass-breakers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Four years after this conversation took place, the event happened, at the
      possibility of which the Town-Clerk had hinted; and Mrs. Gray presented
      her husband with an infant daughter. But good and evil are strangely
      mingled in this sublunary world. The fulfilment of his anxious longing for
      posterity was attended with the loss of his simple and kind-hearted wife;
      one of the most heavy blows which fate could inflict on poor Gideon, and,
      his house was made desolate even by the event which had promised for
      months before to add new comforts to its humble roof. Gray felt the shock
      as men of sense and firmness feel a decided blow, from the effects of
      which they never hope again fully to raise themselves. He discharged the
      duties of his profession with the same punctuality as ever, was easy, and
      even to appearance, cheerful in his intercourse with society; but the
      sunshine of existence was gone. Every morning he missed the affectionate
      charges which recommended to him to pay attention to his own health while
      he was labouring to restore that blessing to his patients. Every evening,
      as he returned from his weary round, it was without the consciousness of a
      kind and affectionate reception from one eager to tell, and interested to
      hear, all the little events of the day. His whistle, which used to arise
      clear and strong so soon as Middlemas steeple was in view, was now for
      ever silenced, and the rider's head drooped, while the tired horse,
      lacking the stimulus of his master's hand and voice, seemed to shuffle
      along as if it experienced a share of his despondency. There were times
      when he was so much dejected as to be unable to endure even the presence
      of his little Menie, in whose infant countenance he could trace the
      lineaments of the mother, of whose loss she had been the innocent and
      unconscious cause. &ldquo;Had it not been for this poor child&rdquo;&mdash;he would
      think; but, instantly aware that the sentiment was sinful, he would snatch
      the infant to his breast, and load it with caresses&mdash;then hastily
      desire it to be removed from the parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mahometans have a fanciful idea, that the true believer, in his
      passage to Paradise, is under the necessity of passing barefooted over a
      bridge composed of red-hot iron. But on this occasion, all the pieces of
      paper which the Moslem has preserved during his life, lest some holy thing
      being written upon them might be profaned, arrange themselves between his
      feet and the burning metal, and so save him from injury. In the same
      manner, the effects of kind and benevolent actions are sometimes found,
      even in this world, to assuage the pangs of subsequent afflictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, the greatest consolation which poor Gideon could find after his
      heavy deprivation, was in the frolic fondness of Richard Middlemas, the
      child who was in so singular a manner thrown upon his charge. Even at this
      early age he was eminently handsome. When silent or out of humour, his
      dark eyes and striking countenance presented some recollections of the
      stern character imprinted on the features of his supposed father; but when
      he was gay and happy, which was much more frequently the case, these
      clouds were exchanged for the most frolicsome, mirthful expression, that
      ever dwelt on the laughing and thoughtless aspect of a child. He seemed to
      have a tact beyond his years in discovering and conforming to the
      peculiarities of human character. His nurse, one prime object of Richard's
      observance, was Nurse Jamieson, or, as she was more commonly called for
      brevity, and <i>par excellence</i>, Nurse. This was the person who had
      brought him up from infancy. She had lost her own child, and soon after
      her husband, and being thus a lone woman, had, as used to be common in
      Scotland, remained a member of Dr. Gray's family. After the death of his
      wife, she gradually obtained the principal superintendence of the whole
      household; and being an honest and capable manager, was a person of very
      great importance in the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was bold in her temper, violent in her feelings, and, as often happens
      with those in her condition, was as much attached to Richard Middlemas,
      whom she had once nursed at her bosom, as if he had been her own son. This
      affection the child repaid by all the tender attentions of which his age
      was capable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dick was also distinguished by the fondest and kindest attachment
      to his guardian and benefactor Dr. Gray. He was officious in the right
      time and place, quiet as a lamb when his patron seemed inclined to study
      or to muse, active and assiduous to assist or divert him whenever it
      seemed to be wished, and, in choosing his opportunities, he seemed to
      display an address far beyond his childish years.
    </p>
    <p>
      As time passed on, this pleasing character seemed to be still more
      refined. In everything like exercise or amusement, he was the pride and
      the leader of the boys of the place, over the most of whom his strength
      and activity gave him a decided superiority. At school his abilities were
      less distinguished, yet he was a favourite with the master, a sensible and
      useful teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard is not swift,&rdquo; he used to say to his patron, Dr. Gray, &ldquo;but then
      he is sure; and it is impossible not to be pleased with a child who is so
      very desirous to give satisfaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Middlemas's grateful affection to his patron seemed to increase with
      the expanding of his faculties, and found a natural and pleasing mode of
      displaying itself in his attentions to little Menie [Footnote: Marion.]
      Gray. Her slightest hint was Richard's law, and it was in vain that he was
      summoned forth by a hundred shrill voices to take the lead in hye-spye, or
      at foot-ball, if it was little Menie's pleasure that he should remain
      within, and build card-houses for her amusement. At other times he would
      take the charge of the little damsel entirely under his own care, and be
      seen wandering with her on the borough common, collecting wild flowers, or
      knitting caps made of bulrushes. Menie was attached to Dick Middlemas, in
      proportion to his affectionate assiduities; and the father saw with
      pleasure every new mark of attention to his child on the part of his
      protege.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the time that Richard was silently advancing from a beautiful child
      into a fine boy, and approaching from a fine boy to the time when he must
      be termed a handsome youth, Mr. Gray wrote twice a-year with much
      regularity to Mr. Moncada, through the channel that gentleman had pointed
      out. The benevolent man thought, that if the wealthy grandfather could
      only see his relative, of whom any family might be proud, he would be
      unable to persevere in his resolution of treating as an outcast one so
      nearly connected with him in blood, and so interesting in person and
      disposition. He thought it his duty, therefore, to keep open the slender
      and oblique communication with the boy's maternal grandfather, as that
      which might, at some future period, lead to a closer connexion. Yet the
      correspondence could not, in other respects, be agreeable to a man of
      spirit like Mr. Gray. His own letters were as short as possible, merely
      rendering an account of his ward's expenses, including a moderate board to
      himself, attested by Mr. Lawford, his co-trustee; and intimating Richard's
      state of health, and his progress in education, with a few words of brief
      but warm eulogy upon his goodness of head and heart. But the answers he
      received were still shorter. &ldquo;Mr. Moncada,&rdquo; such was their usual tenor,
      &ldquo;acknowledges Mr. Gray's letter of such a date, notices the contents, and
      requests Mr. Gray to persist in the plan which he has hitherto prosecuted
      on the subject of their correspondence.&rdquo; On occasions where extraordinary
      expenses seemed likely to be incurred, the remittances were made with
      readiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day fortnight after Mrs. Gray's death, fifty pounds were received,
      with a note, intimating that it was designed to put the child R. M. into
      proper mourning. The writer had added two or three words, desiring that
      the surplus should be at Mr. Gray's disposal, to meet the additional
      expenses of this period of calamity; but Mr. Moncada had left the phrase
      unfinished, apparently in despair of turning it suitably into English.
      Gideon, without farther investigation, quietly added the sum to the
      account of his ward's little fortune, contrary to the opinion of Mr.
      Lawford,&mdash;who, aware that he was rather a loser than a gainer by the
      boy's residence in his house, was desirous that his friend should not omit
      an opportunity of recovering some part of his expenses on that score. But
      Gray was proof against all remonstrances.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the boy advanced towards his fourteenth year, Dr. Gray wrote a more
      elaborate account of his ward's character, acquirements, and capacity. He
      added that he did this for the purpose of enabling Mr. Moncada to judge
      how the young man's future education should be directed. Richard, he
      observed, was arrived at the point where education, losing its original
      and general character, branches off into different paths of knowledge,
      suitable to particular professions, and when it was therefore become
      necessary to determine which of them it was his pleasure that young
      Richard should be trained for; and he would, on his part, do all he could
      to carry Mr. Moncada's wishes into execution, since the amiable qualities
      of the boy made him as dear to him, though but a guardian, as he could
      have been to his own father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer, which arrived in the course of a week or ten days, was fuller
      than usual, and written in the first person.&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Gray,&rdquo; such was
      the tenor, &ldquo;our meeting has been under such circumstances as could not
      make us favourably known to each other at the time. But I have the
      advantage of you, since, knowing your motives for entertaining an
      indifferent opinion of me, I could respect them, and you at the same time;
      whereas you, unable to comprehend the motives&mdash;I say, you, being
      unacquainted with the infamous treatment I had received, could not
      understand the reasons that I have for acting as I have done. Deprived,
      sir, by the act of a villain, of my child, and she despoiled of honour, I
      cannot bring myself to think of beholding the creature, however innocent,
      whose look must always remind me of hatred and of shame. Keep the poor
      child by you&mdash;educate him to your own profession, but take heed that
      he looks no higher than to fill such a situation in life as you yourself
      worthily occupy, or some other line of like importance. For the condition
      of a farmer, a country lawyer, a medical practitioner, or some such
      retired course of life, the means of outfit and education shall be amply
      supplied. But I must warn him and you, that any attempt to intrude himself
      on me further than I may especially permit, will be attended with the
      total forfeiture of my favour and protection. So, having made known my
      mind to you, I expect you will act accordingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The receipt of this letter determined Gideon to have some explanation with
      the boy himself, in order to learn if he had any choice among the
      professions thus opened to him; convinced at the same time, from his
      docility of temper, that he would refer the selection to his (Dr. Gray's)
      better judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had previously, however, the unpleasing task of acquainting Richard
      Middlemas with the mysterious circumstances attending his birth, of which
      he presumed him to be entirely ignorant, simply because he himself had
      never communicated them, but had let the boy consider himself as the
      orphan child of a distant relation. But though the Doctor himself was
      silent, he might have remembered that Nurse Jamieson had the handsome
      enjoyment of her tongue, and was disposed to use it liberally.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a very early period, Nurse Jamieson, amongst the variety of legendary
      lore which she instilled into her foster-son, had not forgotten what she
      called the awful season of his coming into the world&mdash;the personable
      appearance of his father, a grand gentleman, who looked as if the whole
      world lay at his feet&mdash;the beauty of his mother, and the terrible
      blackness of the mask which she wore, her een that glanced like diamonds,
      and the diamonds she wore on her fingers, that could be compared to
      nothing but her own een, the fairness of her skin, and the colour of her
      silk rokelay, with much proper stuff to the same purpose. Then she
      expatiated on the arrival of his grandfather, and the awful man, armed
      with pistol, dirk, and claymore, (the last weapons existed only in Nurse's
      imagination,) the very Ogre of a fairy tale&mdash;then all the
      circumstances of the carrying off his mother, while bank-notes were flying
      about the house like screeds of brown paper, and gold guineas were as
      plenty as chuckie-stanes. All this, partly to please and interest the boy,
      partly to indulge her own talent for amplification, Nurse told with so
      many additional circumstances, and gratuitous commentaries, that the real
      transaction, mysterious and odd as it certainly was sunk into tameness
      before the Nurse's edition, like humble prose contrasted with the boldest
      nights of poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      To hear all this did Richard seriously incline, and still more was he
      interested with the idea of his valiant father coming for him unexpectedly
      at the head of a gallant regiment, with music playing and colours flying,
      and carrying his son away on the most beautiful pony eyes ever beheld; Or
      his mother, bright as the day, might suddenly appear in her coach-and-six,
      to reclaim her beloved child; or his repentant grandfather, with his
      pockets stuffed out with banknotes, would come to atone for his past
      cruelty, by heaping his neglected grandchild with unexpected wealth. Sure
      was Nurse Jamieson, &ldquo;that it wanted but a blink of her bairn's bonny ee to
      turn their hearts, as Scripture sayeth; and as strange things had been, as
      they should come a'thegither to the town at the same time, and make such a
      day as had never been seen in Middlemas; and then her bairn would never be
      called by that Lowland name of Middlemas any more, which sounded as if it
      had been gathered out of the town gutter; but would be called Galatian
      [Footnote: Galatian is a name of a person famous in Christmas gambols.],
      or Sir William Wallace, or Robin Hood, or after some other of the great
      princes named in story-books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nurse Jamieson's history of the past, and prospects of the future, were
      too flattering not to excite the most ambitious visions in the mind of a
      boy, who naturally felt a strong desire of rising in the world, and was
      conscious of possessing the powers necessary to his advancement. The
      incidents of his birth resembled those he found commemorated in the tales
      which he read or listened to; and there seemed no reason why his own
      adventures should not have a termination corresponding to those of such
      veracious histories. In a word, while good Doctor Gray imagined that his
      pupil was dwelling in utter ignorance of his origin, Richard was
      meditating upon nothing else than the time and means by which he
      anticipated his being extricated from the obscurity of his present
      condition, and enabled to assume the rank, to which, in his own opinion,
      he was entitled by birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      So stood the feelings of the young man, when, one day after dinner, the
      Doctor snuffing the candle, and taking from his pouch the great leathern
      pocketbook in which he deposited particular papers, with a small supply of
      the most necessary and active medicines, he took from it Mr. Moncada's
      letter, and requested Richard Middlemas's serious attention, while he told
      him some circumstances concerning himself, which it greatly imported him
      to know. Richard's dark eyes flashed fire&mdash;the blood flushed his
      broad and well-formed forehead&mdash;the hour of explanation was at length
      come. He listened to the narrative of Gideon Gray, which, the reader may
      believe, being altogether divested of the gilding which Nurse Jamieson's
      imagination had bestowed upon it, and reduced to what mercantile men
      termed the <i>needful</i>, exhibited little more than the tale of a child
      of shame, deserted by its father and mother, and brought up on the
      reluctant charity of a more distant relation, who regarded him as the
      living though unconscious evidence of the disgrace of his family, and
      would more willingly have paid for the expenses of his funeral, than that
      of the food which was grudgingly provided for him. &ldquo;Temple and tower,&rdquo; a
      hundred flattering edifices of Richard's childish imagination, went to the
      ground at once, and the pain which attended their demolition was rendered
      the more acute, by a sense of shame that he should have nursed such
      reveries. He remained while Gideon continued his explanation, in a
      dejected posture, his eyes fixed on the ground, and the veins of his
      forehead swoln with contending passions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, my dear Richard,&rdquo; said the good surgeon, &ldquo;you must think what
      you can do for yourself, since your grandfather leaves you the choice of
      three honourable professions, by any of which, well and wisely prosecuted,
      you may become independent if not wealthy, and respectable if not great.
      You will naturally desire a little time for consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a minute,&rdquo; said the boy, raising his head, and looking boldly at his
      guardian. &ldquo;I am a free-born Englishman, and will return to England if I
      think fit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A free-born fool you are,&rdquo;&mdash;said Gray; &ldquo;you were born, as I think,
      and no one can know better than I do, in the blue room of Stevenlaw's
      Land, in the Town-head of Middlemas, if you call that being a free-born
      Englishman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Tom Hillary,&rdquo;&mdash;this was an apprentice of Clerk Lawford, who had
      of late been a great friend and adviser of young Middlemas&mdash;&ldquo;Tom
      Hillary says that I am a free-born Englishman, notwithstanding, in right
      of my parents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh, child! what do we know of your parents?&mdash;But what has your
      being an Englishman to do with the present question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Doctor!&rdquo; answered the boy bitterly, &ldquo;you know we from the south side
      of Tweed cannot scramble so hard as you do. The Scots are too moral, and
      too prudent, and too robust, for a poor pudding-eater to live amongst
      them, whether as a parson, or as a lawyer, or as a doctor&mdash;with your
      pardon, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my life, Dick,&rdquo; said Gray, &ldquo;this Tom Hillary will turn your brain.
      What is the meaning of all this trash?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom Hillary says that the parson lives by the sins of the people, the
      lawyer by their distresses, and the doctor by their diseases&mdash;always
      asking your pardon, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom Hillary,&rdquo; replied the Doctor, &ldquo;should be drummed out of the borough.
      A whipper-snapper of an attorney's apprentice, run away from Newcastle! If
      I hear him talking so, I'll teach him to speak with more reverence of the
      learned professions. Let me hear no more of Tom Hillary whom you have seen
      far too much of lately. Think a little, like a lad of sense, and tell me
      what answer I am to give to Mr. Moncada.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; said the boy, the tone of affected sarcasm laid aside, and
      that of injured pride substituted in its room, &ldquo;Tell him that my soul
      revolts at the obscure lot he recommends to me. I am determined to enter
      my father's profession, the army, unless my grandfather chooses to receive
      me into his house, and place me in his own line of business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and make you his partner, I suppose, and acknowledge you for his
      heir?&rdquo; said Dr. Gray; &ldquo;a thing extremely likely to happen, no doubt,
      considering the way in which he has brought you up all along, and the
      terms in which he now writes concerning you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, sir, there is one thing which I can demand of you,&rdquo; replied the
      boy. &ldquo;There is a large sum of money in your hands belonging to me; and
      since it is consigned to you for my use, I demand you should make the
      necessary advances to procure a commission in the army&mdash;account to me
      for the balance&mdash;and so, with thanks for past favours, I will give
      you no trouble in future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said the Doctor, gravely, &ldquo;I am very sorry to see that your
      usual prudence and good humour are not proof against the disappointment of
      some idle expectations which you had not the slightest reason to
      entertain. It is very true that there is a sum, which, in spite of various
      expenses, may still approach to a thousand pounds or better, which remains
      in my hands for your behoof. But I am bound to dispose of it according to
      the will of the donor; and at any rate, you are not entitled to call for
      it until you come to years of discretion; a period from which you are six
      years distant, according to law, and which, in one sense, you will never
      reach at all, unless you alter your present unreasonable crotchets. But
      come, Dick, this is the first time I have seen you in so absurd a humour,
      and you have many things, I own, in your situation to apologize for
      impatience even greater than you have displayed. But you should not turn
      your resentment on me, that am no way in fault. You should remember that I
      was your earliest and only friend, and took charge of you when every other
      person forsook you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not thank you for it,&rdquo; said Richard, giving way to a burst of
      uncontrolled passion. &ldquo;You might have done better for me had you pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in what manner, you ungrateful boy?&rdquo; said Gray, whose composure was a
      little ruffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might have flung me under the wheels of their carriages as they drove
      off, and have let them trample on the body of their child, as they have
      done on his feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he rushed out of the room, and shut the door behind him with
      great violence, leaving his guardian astonished at his sudden and violent
      change of temper and manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the deuce can have possessed him? Ah, well. High-spirited, and
      disappointed in some follies which that Tom Hillary has put into his head.
      But his is a case for anodynes, and shall be treated accordingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the Doctor formed this good-natured resolution, young Middlemas
      rushed to Nurse Jamieson's apartment, where poor Menie, to whom his
      presence always gave holyday feelings, hastened to exhibit, for his
      admiration, a new doll, of which she had made the acquisition. No one,
      generally, was more interested in Menie's amusements than Richard; but at
      present, Richard, like his celebrated namesake, was not i'the vein. He
      threw off the little damsel so carelessly, almost so rudely, that the doll
      flew out of Menie's hand, fell on the hearth-stone, and broke its waxen
      face. The rudeness drew from Nurse Jamieson a rebuke, even although the
      culprit was her darling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hout awa', Richard&mdash;that wasna like yoursell, to guide Miss Menie
      that gate.&mdash;Haud your tongue, Miss Menie, and I'll soon mend the
      baby's face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But if Menie cried, she did not cry for the doll; and while the tears
      flowed silently down her cheeks, she sat looking at Dick Middlemas with a
      childish face of fear, sorrow, and wonder. Nurse Jamieson was soon
      diverted from her attention to Menie Gray's distresses, especially as she
      did not weep aloud, and her attention became fixed on the altered
      countenance, red eyes, and swoln features of her darling foster-child. She
      instantly commenced an investigation into the cause of his distress, after
      the usual inquisitorial manner of matrons of her class. &ldquo;What is the
      matter wi' my bairn?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wha has been vexing my bairn?&rdquo; with similar
      questions, at last extorted this reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not your bairn&mdash;I am no one's bairn&mdash;no one's son. I am an
      outcast from my family, and belong to no one. Dr. Gray has told me so
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did he cast up to my bairn that he was a bastard?&mdash;troth he was
      na blate&mdash;my certie, your father was a better man than ever stood on
      the Doctor's shanks&mdash;a handsome grand gentleman, with an ee like a
      gled's, and a step like a Highland piper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nurse Jamieson had got on a favourite topic, and would have expatiated
      long enough, for she was a professed admirer of masculine beauty, but
      there was something which displeased the boy in her last simile; so he cut
      the conversation short, by asking whether she knew exactly how much money
      his grandfather had left with Dr. Gray for his maintenance. &ldquo;She could not
      say&mdash;didna ken&mdash;an awfu' sum it was to pass out of ae man's hand&mdash;She
      was sure it wasna less than ae hundred pounds, and it might weel be twa.&rdquo;
       In short, she knew nothing about the matter; &ldquo;but she was sure Dr. Gray
      would count to him to the last farthing; for everybody kend that he was a
      just man where siller was concerned. However, if her bairn wanted to ken
      mair about it, to be sure the Town-clerk could tell him all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard Middlemas arose and left the apartment, without saying more. He
      went immediately to visit the old Town-clerk, to whom he had made himself
      acceptable, as, indeed, he had done to most of the dignitaries about the
      burgh. He introduced the conversation by the proposal which had been made
      to him for choosing a profession, and, after speaking of the mysterious
      circumstances of his birth, and the doubtful prospects which lay before
      him, he easily led the Town-clerk into conversation as to the amount of
      the funds, and heard the exact state of the money in his guardian's hands,
      which corresponded with the information he had already received. He next
      sounded the worthy scribe on the possibility of his going into the army;
      but received a second confirmation of the intelligence Mr. Gray had given
      him; being informed that no part of the money could be placed at his
      disposal till he was of age; and then not without the especial consent of
      both his guardians, and particularly that of his master. He therefore took
      leave of the Town-clerk, who, much approving the cautious manner in which
      he spoke, and his prudent selection of an adviser at this important crisis
      of his life, intimated to him, that should he choose the law, he would
      himself receive him into his office, upon a very moderate apprentice-fee,
      and would part with Tom Hillary to make room for him, as the lad was
      &ldquo;rather pragmatical, and plagued him with speaking about his English
      practice, which they had nothing to do with on this side of the Border&mdash;the
      Lord be thanked!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Middlemas thanked him for his kindness, and promised to consider his kind
      offer, in case he should determine upon following the profession of the
      law.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Tom Hillary's master, Richard went to Tom Hillary himself, who
      chanced then to be in the office. He was a lad about twenty, as smart as
      small, but distinguished for the accuracy with which he dressed his hair,
      and the splendour of a laced hat and embroidered waistcoat, with which he
      graced the church of Middlemas on Sundays. Tom Hillary had been bred an
      attorney's clerk in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, but, for some reason or other,
      had found it more convenient of late years to reside in Scotland, and was
      recommended to the Town-clerk of Middlemas, by the accuracy and beauty
      with which he transcribed the records of the burgh. It is not improbable
      that the reports concerning the singular circumstances of Richard
      Middlemas's birth, and the knowledge that he was actually possessed of a
      considerable sum of money, induced Hillary, though so much his senior, to
      admit the lad to his company, and enrich his youthful mind with some
      branches of information, which in that retired corner, his pupil might
      otherwise have been some time in attaining. Amongst these were certain
      games at cards and dice, in which the pupil paid, as was reasonable, the
      price of initiation by his losses to his instructor. After a long walk
      with this youngster, whose advice, like the unwise son of the wisest of
      men, he probably valued more than that of his more aged counsellors,
      Richard Middlemas returned to his lodgings in Stevenlaw's Land, and went
      to bed sad and supperless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Richard arose with the sun, and his night's rest appeared
      to have had its frequent effect, in cooling the passions and correcting
      the understanding. Little Menie was the first person to whom he made the
      <i>amende honorable;</i> and a much smaller propitiation than the new doll
      with which he presented her would have been accepted as an atonement for a
      much greater offence. Menie was one of those pure spirits, to whom a state
      of unkindness, if the estranged person has been a friend, is a state of
      pain, and the slightest advance of her friend and protector was sufficient
      to regain all her childish confidence and affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father did not prove more inexorable than Menie had done. Mr. Gray,
      indeed, thought he had good reason to look cold upon Richard at their next
      meeting, being not a little hurt at the ungrateful treatment which he had
      received on the preceding evening. But Middlemas disarmed him at once, by
      frankly pleading that he had suffered his mind to be carried away by the
      supposed rank and importance of his parents, into an idle conviction that
      he was one day to share them. The letter of his grandfather, which
      condemned him to banishment and obscurity for life, was, he acknowledged,
      a very severe blow; and it was with deep sorrow that he reflected, that
      the irritation of his disappointment had led him to express himself in a
      manner far short of the respect and reverence of one who owed Mr. Gray the
      duty and affection of a son, and ought to refer to his decision every
      action of his life. Gideon, propitiated by an admission so candid, and
      made with so much humility, readily dismissed his resentment, and kindly
      enquired of Richard, whether he had bestowed any reflection upon the
      choice of profession which had been subjected to him; offering, at the
      same time, to allow him all reasonable time to make up his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this subject. Richard Middlemas answered with the same promptitude and
      candour.&mdash;&ldquo;He had,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in order to forming his opinion more
      safely, consulted with his friend, the Town-clerk.&rdquo; The Doctor nodded
      approbation. &ldquo;Mr. Lawford had, indeed, been most friendly, and had even
      offered to take him into his own office. But if his father and benefactor
      would permit him to study, under his instructions, the noble art in which
      he himself enjoyed such a deserved reputation, the mere hope that he might
      by-and-by be of some use to Mr. Gray in his business, would greatly
      overbalance every other consideration. Such a course of education, and
      such a use of professional knowledge when he had acquired it, would be a
      greater spur to his industry than the prospect even of becoming Town-clerk
      of Middlemas in his proper person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the young man expressed it to be his firm and unalterable choice, to
      study medicine under his guardian, and to remain a member of his family,
      Dr. Gray informed Mr. Moncada of the lad's determination; who, to testify
      his approbation, remitted to the Doctor the sum of L100 as apprentice fee,
      a sum nearly three times as much as Gray's modesty had hinted at as
      necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after, when Dr. Gray and the Town-clerk met at the small club of
      the burgh, their joint theme was the sense and steadiness of Richard
      Middlemas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said the Town-clerk, &ldquo;he is such a friendly and disinterested
      boy, that I could not get him to accept a place in my office, for fear he
      should be thought to be pushing himself forward at the expense of Tam
      Hillary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, indeed, Clerk,&rdquo; said Gray, &ldquo;I have sometimes been afraid that he
      kept too much company with that Tam Hillary of yours; but twenty Tam
      Hillarys would not corrupt Dick Middlemas.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER THE THIRD.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Dick was come to high renown
   Since he commenced physician;
 Tom was held by all the town
   The better politician.
                   TOM AND DICK.
</pre>
    <p>
      At the same period when Dr. Gray took under his charge his youthful lodger
      Richard Middlemas, he received proposals from the friends of one Adam
      Hartley, to receive him also as an apprentice. The lad was the son of a
      respectable farmer on the English side of the Border, who educating his
      eldest son to his own occupation, desired to make his second a medical
      man, in order to avail himself of the friendship of a great man, his
      landlord, who had offered to assist his views in life, and represented a
      doctor or surgeon as the sort of person to whose advantage his interest
      could be most readily applied. Middlemas and Hartley were therefore
      associated in their studies. In winter they were boarded in Edinburgh, for
      attending the medical classes which were necessary for taking their
      degree. Three or four years thus passed on, and, from being mere boys, the
      two medical aspirants shot up into young men, who, being both very
      good-looking, well dressed, well bred, and having money in their pockets,
      became personages of some importance in the little town of Middlemas,
      where there was scarce any thing that could be termed an aristocracy, and
      in which beaux were scarce and belles were plenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of the two had his especial partizans; for though the young men
      themselves lived in tolerable harmony together, yet, as usual in such
      cases, no one could approve of one of them, without at the same time
      comparing him with, and asserting his superiority over his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both were gay, fond of dancing, and sedulous attendants on the <i>practeezings</i>,
      as he called them, of Mr. McFittoch, a dancing master, who, itinerant
      during the summer, became stationary in the winter season, and afforded
      the youth of Middlemas the benefit of his instructions at the rate of
      twenty lessons for five shillings sterling. On these occasions, each of
      Dr. Gray's pupils had his appropriate praise. Hartley danced with most
      spirit&mdash;Middlemas with a better grace. Mr. McFittoch would have
      turned out Richard against the country-side in the minuet, and wagered the
      thing dearest to him in the world, (and that was his kit,) upon his
      assured superiority; but he admitted Hartley was superior to him in
      hornpipes, jigs, strathspeys, and reels.
    </p>
    <p>
      In dress, Hartley was most expensive, perhaps because his father afforded
      him better means of being so; but his clothes were neither so tasteful
      when new, nor so well preserved when they began to grow old, as those of
      Richard Middlemas. Adam Hartley was sometimes fine, at other times rather
      slovenly, and on the former occasions looked rather too conscious of his
      splendour. His chum was at all times regularly neat and well dressed;
      while at the same time he had an air of good-breeding, which made him
      appear always at ease; so that his dress, whatever it was, seemed to be
      just what he ought to have worn at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In their persons there was a still more strongly marked distinction. Adam
      Hartley was full middle size, stout, and well limbed; and an open English
      countenance, of the genuine Saxon mould, showed itself among chestnut
      locks, until the hair-dresser destroyed them. He loved the rough exercises
      of wrestling, boxing, leaping, and quarterstaff, and frequented, when he
      could obtain leisure, the bull-baitings and foot-ball matches, by which
      the burgh was sometimes enlivened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard, on the contrary, was dark, like his father and mother, with high
      features, beautifully formed, but exhibiting something of a foreign
      character; and his person was tall and slim, though muscular and active.
      His address and manners must have been natural to him, for they were, in
      elegance and ease, far beyond any example which he could have found in his
      native burgh. He learned the use of the small-sword while in Edinburgh,
      and took lessons from a performer at the theatre, with the purpose of
      refining his mode of speaking. He became also an amateur of the drama,
      regularly attending the playhouse, and assuming the tone of a critic in
      that and other lighter departments of literature. To fill up the contrast,
      so far as taste was concerned, Richard was a dexterous and successful
      angler&mdash;Adam, a bold and unerring shot. Their efforts to surpass each
      other in supplying Dr. Gray's table, rendered his housekeeping much
      preferable to what it had been on former occasions; and, besides, small
      presents of fish and game are always agreeable amongst the inhabitants of
      a country town, and contributed to increase the popularity of the young
      sportsmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the burgh was divided, for lack of better subject of disputation,
      concerning the comparative merits of Dr. Gray's two apprentices, he
      himself was sometimes chosen the referee. But in this, as on other
      matters, the Doctor was cautious. He said the lads were both good lads,
      and would be useful men in the profession, if their heads were not carried
      with the notice which the foolish people of the burgh took of them, and
      the parties of pleasure that were so often taking them away from their
      business. No doubt it was natural for him to feel more confidence in
      Hartley, who came of ken'd folk, and was very near as good as a born
      Scotsman. But if he did feel such a partiality, he blamed himself for it,
      since the stranger child, so oddly cast upon his hands, had peculiar good
      right to such patronage and affection as he had to bestow; and truly the
      young man himself seemed so grateful, that it was impossible for him to
      hint the slightest wish, that Dick Middlemas did not hasten to execute.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were persons in the burgh of Middlemas who were indiscreet enough to
      suppose that Miss Menie must be a better judge than any other person of
      the comparative merits of these accomplished personages, respecting which
      the public opinion was generally divided. No one even of her greatest
      intimates ventured to put the question to her in precise terms; but her
      conduct was narrowly observed, and the critics remarked, that to Adam
      Hartley her attentions were given more freely and frankly. She laughed
      with him, chatted with him, and danced with him; while to Dick Middlemas
      her conduct was more shy and distant. The premises seemed certain, but the
      public were divided in the conclusions which were to be drawn from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not possible for the young men to be the subject of such
      discussions without being sensible that they existed; and thus, contrasted
      together by the little society in which they moved, they must have been
      made of better than ordinary clay, if they had not themselves entered by
      degrees into the spirit of the controversy, and considered themselves as
      rivals for public applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor is it to be forgotten, that Menie Gray was by this time shot up into
      one of the prettiest young women, not of Middlemas only, but of the whole
      county, in which the little burgh is situated. This, indeed, had been
      settled by evidence, which could not be esteemed short of decisive. At the
      time of the races, there were usually assembled in the burgh some company
      of the higher classes from the country around, and many of the sober
      burghers mended their incomes, by letting their apartments, or taking in
      lodgers of quality for the busy week. All the rural thanes and thanesses
      attended on these occasions; and such was the number of cocked hats and
      silken trains, that the little town seemed for a time totally to have
      changed its inhabitants. On this occasion persons of a certain quality
      only were permitted to attend upon the nightly balls which were given in
      the old Town-house, and the line of distinction excluded Mr. Gray's
      family.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aristocracy, however, used their privileges with some feelings of
      deference to the native beaux and belles of the burgh, who were thus
      doomed to hear the fiddles nightly, without being permitted to dance to
      them. One evening in the race-week, termed the Hunter's ball, was
      dedicated to general amusement, and liberated from the usual restrictions
      of etiquette. On this occasion all the respectable families in the town
      were invited to share the amusement of the evening, and to wonder at the
      finery, and be grateful for the condescension, of their betters. This was
      especially the case with the females, for the number of invitations to the
      gentlemen of the town was much more limited. Now, at this general muster,
      the beauty of Miss Gray's face and person had placed her, in the opinion
      of all competent judges, decidedly at the head of all the belles present,
      saving those with whom, according to the ideas of the place, it would
      hardly have been decent to compare her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Laird of the ancient and distinguished house of Louponheight did not
      hesitate to engage her hand during the greater part of the evening; and
      his mother, renowned for her stern assertion of the distinctions of rank,
      placed the little plebeian beside her at supper, and was heard to say,
      that the surgeon's daughter behaved very prettily indeed, and seemed to
      know perfectly well where and what she was. As for the young Laird
      himself, he capered so high, and laughed so uproariously, as to give rise
      to a rumour, that he was minded to &ldquo;shoot madly from his sphere,&rdquo; and to
      convert the village Doctor's daughter into a lady of his own ancient name.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this memorable evening, Middlemas and Hartley, who had found room
      in the music gallery, witnessed the scene, and, as it would seem, with
      very different feelings. Hartley was evidently annoyed by the excess of
      attention which the gallant Laird of Louponheight, stimulated by the
      influence of a couple of bottles of claret, and by the presence of a
      partner who danced remarkably well, paid to Miss Menie Gray. He saw from
      his lofty stand all the dumb show of gallantry, with the comfortable
      feelings of a famishing creature looking upon a feast which he is not
      permitted to share, and regarded every extraordinary frisk of the jovial
      Laird, as the same might have been looked upon by a gouty person, who
      apprehended that the dignitary was about to descend on his toes. At
      length, unable to restrain his emotion, he left the gallery and returned
      no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far different was the demeanour of Middlemas. He seemed gratified and
      elevated by the attention which was generally paid to Miss Gray, and by
      the admiration she excited. On the valiant Laird of Louponheight he looked
      with indescribable contempt, and amused himself with pointing out to the
      burgh dancing-master, who acted <i>pro tempore</i> as one of the band, the
      frolicsome bounds and pirouettes, in which that worthy displayed a great
      deal more of vigour than of grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But ye shouldna laugh sae loud, Master Dick,&rdquo; said the master of capers;
      &ldquo;he hasna had the advantage of a real gracefu' teacher, as ye have had;
      and troth, if he listed to tak some lessons, I think I could make some
      hand of his feet, for he is a souple chield, and has a gallant instep of
      his ain; and sic a laced hat hasna been seen on the causeway of Middlemas
      this mony a day.&mdash;Ye are standing laughing there, Dick Middlemas; I
      would have you be sure he does not cut you out with your bonny partner
      yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He be&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; Middlemas was beginning a sentence which he could
      not have concluded with strict attention to propriety, when the master of
      the band summoned McFittoch to his post, by the following ireful
      expostulation:&mdash;&ldquo;What are ye about, sir? Mind your bow-hand. How the
      deil d'ye think three fiddles is to keep down a bass, if yin o' them
      stands girning and gabbling as ye're doing? Play up, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick Middlemas, thus reduced to silence, continued, from his lofty
      station, like one of the gods of the Epicureans, to survey what passed
      below, without the gaieties which he witnessed being able to excite more
      than a smile, which seemed, however, rather to indicate a good-humoured
      contempt for what was passing, than a benevolent sympathy with the
      pleasures of others.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Now hold thy tongue, Billy Bewick, he said,
    Of peaceful talking: let me be;
  But if thou art a man, as I think thou art,
    Come ower the dyke and fight with me.
                           BORDER MINSTRELSY.
</pre>
    <p>
      On the morning after this gay evening, the two young men were labouring
      together in a plot of ground behind Stevenlaw's Land, which the Doctor had
      converted into a garden, where he raised, with a view to pharmacy as well
      as botany, some rare plants, which obtained the place from the vulgar the
      sounding name of the Physic Garden. [Footnote: The Botanic Garden is so
      termed by the vulgar of Edinburgh.] Mr. Gray's pupils readily complied
      with his wishes, that they would take some care of this favourite spot, to
      which both contributed their labours, after which Hartley used to devote
      himself to the cultivation of the kitchen garden, which he had raised into
      this respectability from a spot not excelling a common kail-yard, while
      Richard Middleman did his utmost to decorate with flowers and shrubs a
      sort of arbour, usually called Miss Menie's bower.
    </p>
    <p>
      At present they were both in the botanic patch of the garden, when Dick
      Middlemas asked Hartley why he had left the ball so soon the evening
      before?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should rather ask you,&rdquo; said Hartley, &ldquo;what pleasure you felt in
      staying there?&mdash;I tell you, Dick, it is a shabby low place this
      Middlemas of ours. In the smallest burgh in England, every decent
      freeholder would have been asked if the Member gave a ball.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Hartley!&rdquo; said his companion, &ldquo;are you, of all men, a candidate for
      the honour of mixing with the first-born of the earth? Mercy on us! How
      will canny Northumberland [throwing a true northern accent on the letter
      R] acquit himself? Methinks I see thee in thy pea-green suit, dancing a
      jig with the honourable Miss Maddie MacFudgeon, while chiefs and thanes
      around laugh as they would do at a hog in armour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't, or perhaps you won't, understand me.&rdquo; said Hartley. &ldquo;I am not
      such a fool as to desire to be hail-fellow-well-met with these fine folks&mdash;I
      care as little for them as they do for me. But as they do not choose to
      ask us to dance, I don't see what business they have with our partners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partners, said you!&rdquo; answered Middlemas; &ldquo;I don't think Menie is very
      often yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As often as I ask her,&rdquo; answered Hartley, rather haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay? Indeed?&mdash;I did not think that.&mdash;And hang me, if I think so
      yet.&rdquo; said Middlemas, with the same sarcastic tone. &ldquo;I tell thee, Adam, I
      will bet you a bowl of punch, that Miss Gray will not dance with you the
      next time you ask her. All I stipulate, is to know the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will lay no bets about Miss Gray,&rdquo; said Hartley; &ldquo;her father is my
      master, and I am obliged to him&mdash;I think I should act very scurvily,
      if I were to make her the subject of any idle debate betwixt you and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very right,&rdquo; replied Middlemas; &ldquo;you should finish one quarrel before you
      begin another. Pray, saddle your pony, ride up to the gate of Louponheight
      Castle, and defy the Baron to mortal combat, for having presumed to touch
      the fair hand of Menie Gray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would leave Miss Gray's name out of the question, and take
      your defiances to your fine folks in your own name, and see what they will
      say to the surgeon's apprentice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak for yourself, if you please, Mr. Adam Hartley. I was not born a
      clown like some folks, and should care little, if I saw it fit, to talk to
      the best of them at the ordinary, and make myself understood too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; answered Hartley, losing patience: &ldquo;you are one of
      themselves, you know&mdash;Middlemas of that Ilk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You scoundrel!&rdquo; said Richard, advancing on him in fury, his taunting
      humour entirely changed into rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand back,&rdquo; said Hartley, &ldquo;or you will come by the worst; if you will
      break rude jests, you must put up with rough answers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will have satisfaction for this insult, by Heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so you shall, if you insist on it,&rdquo; said Hartley; &ldquo;but better, I
      think, to say no more about the matter. We have both spoken what would
      have been better left unsaid. I was in the wrong to say what I said to
      you, although you did provoke me. And now I have given you as much
      satisfaction as a reasonable man can ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; repeated Middlemas, &ldquo;the satisfaction which I demand, is that of a
      gentleman&mdash;the Doctor has a pair of pistols.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a pair of mortars also, which are heartily at your service,
      gentlemen,&rdquo; said Mr. Gray, coming forward from behind a yew hedge, where
      he had listened to the whole or greater part of this dispute. &ldquo;A fine
      story it would be of my apprentices shooting each other with my own
      pistols! Let me see either of you fit to treat a gunshot wound, before you
      think of inflicting one. Go, you are both very foolish boys, and I cannot
      take it kind of either of you to bring the name of my daughter into such
      disputes as these. Hark ye, lads, ye both owe me, I think, some portion of
      respect, and even of gratitude&mdash;it will be a poor return, if instead
      of living quietly with this poor motherless girl, like brothers with a
      sister, you should oblige me to increase my expense, and abridge my
      comfort, by sending my child from me, for the few months that you are to
      remain here. Let me see you shake hands, and let us have no more of this
      nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While their master spoke in this manner, both the young men stood before
      him in the attitude of self-convicted criminals. At the conclusion of his
      rebuke, Hartley turned frankly round, and, offered his hand to his
      companion, who accepted it, but after a moment's hesitation. There was
      nothing farther passed on the subject, but the lads never resumed the same
      sort of intimacy which had existed betwixt them in their earlier
      acquaintance. On the contrary, avoiding every connexion not absolutely
      required by their situation, and abridging as much as possible even their
      indispensable intercourse in professional matters, they seemed as much
      estranged from each other as two persons residing in the same small house
      had the means of being.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Menie Gray, her father did not appear to entertain the least
      anxiety upon her account, although from his frequent and almost daily
      absence from home, she was exposed to constant intercourse with two
      handsome young men, both, it might be supposed, ambitious of pleasing her
      more than most parents would have deemed entirely prudent. Nor was Nurse
      Jamieson,&mdash;her menial situation, and her excessive partiality for her
      foster-son, considered,&mdash;altogether such a matron as could afford her
      protection. Gideon, however, knew that his daughter possessed, in its
      fullest extent, the upright and pure integrity of his own character, and
      that never father had less reason to apprehend that a daughter should
      deceive his confidence; and justly secure of her principles, he overlooked
      the danger to which he exposed her feelings and affections.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intercourse betwixt Menie and the young men seemed now of a guarded
      kind on all sides. Their meeting was only at meals, and Miss Gray was at
      pains, perhaps by her father's recommendation, to treat them with the same
      degree of attention. This, however, was no easy matter; for Hartley became
      so retiring, cold, and formal, that it was impossible for her to sustain
      any prolonged intercourse with him; whereas Middlemas, perfectly at his
      ease, sustained his part as formerly upon all occasions that occurred, and
      without appearing to press his intimacy assiduously, seemed nevertheless
      to retain the complete possession of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time drew nigh at length when the young men, freed from the
      engagements of their indentures, must look to play their own independent
      part in the world. Mr. Gray informed Richard Middlemas that he had written
      pressingly upon the subject to Moncada, and that more than once, but had
      not yet received an answer; nor did he presume to offer his own advice,
      until the pleasure of his grandfather should be known. Richard seemed to
      endure this suspense with more patience than the Doctor thought belonged
      naturally to his character. He asked no questions&mdash;stated no
      conjectures&mdash;showed no anxiety, but seemed to await with patience the
      turn which events should take. &ldquo;My young gentleman,&rdquo; thought Mr. Gray,
      &ldquo;has either fixed on some course in his own mind, or he is about to be
      more tractable than some points of his character have led me to expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Richard had made an experiment on this inflexible relative, by
      sending Mr. Moncada a letter full of duty, and affection, and gratitude,
      desiring to be permitted to correspond with him in person, and promising
      to be guided in every particular by his will. The answer to this appeal
      was his own letter returned, with a note from the bankers whose cover had
      been used, saying, that any future attempt to intrude on Mr. Moncada,
      would put a final period to their remittances.
    </p>
    <p>
      While things were in this situation in Stevenlaw's Land, Adam Hartley one
      evening, contrary to his custom for several months, sought a private
      interview with his fellow-apprentice. He found him in the little arbour,
      and could not omit observing, that Dick Middlemas, on his appearance,
      shoved into his bosom a small packet, as if afraid of its being seen, and
      snatching up a hoe, began to work with great devotion, like one who wished
      to have it thought that his whole soul was in his occupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wished to speak with you, Mr. Middlemas,&rdquo; said Hartley; &ldquo;but I fear I
      interrupt you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo;' said the other, laying down his hoe; &ldquo;I was only
      scratching up the weeds which the late showers have made rush up so
      numerously. I am at your service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hartley proceeded to the arbour, and seated himself. Richard imitated his
      example, and seemed to wait for the proposed communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had an interesting communication with Mr. Gray&rdquo;&mdash;said
      Hartley, and there stopped, like one who finds himself entering upon a
      difficult task.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope the explanation has been satisfactory?&rdquo; said Middlemas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall judge.&mdash;Doctor Gray was pleased to say something to me
      very civil about my proficiency in the duties of our profession; and, to
      my great astonishment, asked me, whether, as he was now becoming old, I
      had any particular objection to continue in my present situation, but with
      some pecuniary advantages, for two years longer; at the end of which he
      promised to me that I should enter into partnership with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Gray is an undoubted judge,&rdquo; said Middlemas, &ldquo;what person will best
      suit him as a professional assistant. The business may be worth L200
      a-year, and an active assistant might go nigh to double it, by riding
      Strath-Devan and the Carse. No great subject for division after all, Mr.
      Hartley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued Hartley, &ldquo;that is not all. The Doctor says&mdash;he
      proposes&mdash;in short, if I can render myself agreeable, in the course
      of these two years, to Miss Menie Gray, he proposes, that when they
      terminate, I should become his son as well as his partner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he kept his eye fixed on Richard's face, which was for a
      moment, strongly agitated; but instantly recovering, he answered, in a
      tone where pique and offended pride vainly endeavoured to disguise
      themselves under an affectation of indifference. &ldquo;Well, Master Adam, I
      cannot but wish you joy of the patriarchal arrangement. You have served
      five years for a professional diploma&mdash;a sort of Leah, that privilege
      of killing and curing. Now you begin a new course of servitude for a
      lovely Rachel. Undoubtedly&mdash;perhaps it is rude in me to ask&mdash;but
      undoubtedly you have accepted so flattering an arrangement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot but recollect there was a condition annexed,&rdquo; said Hartley,
      gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That of rendering yourself acceptable to a girl you have known for so
      many years?&rdquo; said Middlemas with a half-suppressed sneer. &ldquo;No great
      difficulty in that, I should think, for such a person as Mr. Hartley, with
      Doctor Gray's favour to back him. No, no-there could be no great obstacle
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both you and I know the contrary, Mr. Middlemas,&rdquo; said Hartley, very
      seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know?&mdash;How should I know any thing more than yourself about the
      state of Miss Gray's inclinations?&rdquo; said Middlemas. &ldquo;I am sure we have had
      equal access to know them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so; but some know better how to avail themselves of
      opportunities. Mr. Middlemas, I have long suspected that you have had the
      inestimable advantages of possessing Miss Gray's affections, and&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; interrupted Middlemas; &ldquo;you are jesting, or you are jealous. You do
      yourself less, and me more, than justice; but the compliment is so great,
      that I am obliged to you for the mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you may know,&rdquo; answered Hartley, &ldquo;I do not speak either by guess, or
      from what you call jealousy, I tell you frankly, that Menie Gray herself
      told me the state of her affections. I naturally communicated to her the
      discourse I had with her father. I told her I was but too well convinced
      that at the present moment I did not possess that interest in her heart,
      which alone might entitle me to request her acquiescence in the views
      which her father's goodness held out to me; but I entreated her not at
      once to decide against me, but give me an opportunity to make way in her
      affections, if possible, trusting that time, and the services which I
      should render to her father, might have an ultimate effect in my favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most natural and modest request. But what did the young lady say in
      reply?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a noble-hearted girl, Richard Middlemas; and for her frankness
      alone, even without her beauty and her good sense, deserves an emperor. I
      cannot express the graceful modesty with which she told me, that she knew
      too well the kindliness, as she was pleased to call it, of my heart, to
      expose me to the protracted pain of an unrequited passion. She candidly
      informed me that she had been long engaged to you in secret&mdash;that you
      had exchanged portraits;&mdash;and though without her father's consent she
      would never become yours, yet she felt it impossible that she should ever
      so far change her sentiments as to afford the most distant prospect of
      success to another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said Middlemas, &ldquo;she has been extremely candid indeed, and
      I am very much obliged to her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And upon <i>my</i> honest word, Mr. Middlemas,&rdquo; returned Hartley, &ldquo;you do
      Miss Gray the greatest injustice&mdash;nay, you are ungrateful to her, if
      you are displeased at her making this declaration. She loves you as a
      woman loves the first object of her affection&mdash;she loves you better&rdquo;&mdash;He
      stopped, and Middlemas completed the sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than I deserve, perhaps?&mdash;Faith, it may well be so, and I
      love her dearly in return. But after all, you know, the secret was mine as
      well as hers, and it would have been better that she had consulted me
      before making it public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Middlemas,&rdquo; said Hartley, earnestly, &ldquo;if the least of this feeling,
      on your part, arises from the apprehension that your secret is less safe
      because it is in my keeping, I can assure you that such is my grateful
      sense of Miss Gray's goodness, in communicating, to save me pain, an
      affair of such delicacy to herself and you, that wild horses should tear
      me limb from limb before they forced a word of it from my lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay, my dear friend,&rdquo; said Middlemas, with a frankness of manner
      indicating a cordiality that had not existed between them for some time,
      &ldquo;you must allow me to be a little jealous in my turn. Your true lover
      cannot have a title to the name, unless he be sometimes unreasonable; and
      somehow, it seems odd she should have chosen for a confidant one whom I
      have often thought a formidable rival; and yet I am so far from being
      displeased, that I do not know that the dear sensible girl could after all
      have made a better choice. It is time that the foolish coldness between us
      should be ended, as you must be sensible that its real cause lay in our
      rivalry. I have much need of good advice, and who can give it to me better
      than the old companion, whose soundness of judgment I have always envied,
      even when some injudicious friends have given me credit for quicker
      parts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hartley accepted Richard's proffered hand, but without any of the buoyancy
      of spirit with which it was offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not intend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to remain many days in this place, perhaps
      not very many hours. But if, in the meanwhile, I can benefit you, by
      advice or otherwise, you may fully command me. It is the only mode in
      which I can be of service to Menie Gray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love my mistress, love me; a happy <i>pendant</i> to the old proverb,
      Love me, love my dog. Well, then, for Menie Gray's sake, if not for Dick
      Middlemas's, (plague on that vulgar tell-tale name,) will you, that are a
      stander-by, tell us, who are the unlucky players, what you think of this
      game of ours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you ask such a question, when the field lies so fair before you?
      I am sure that Dr. Gray would retain you as his assistant upon the same
      terms which he proposed to me. You are the better match, in all worldly
      respects, for his daughter, having some capital to begin the world with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All true&mdash;but methinks Mr. Gray has showed no great predilection for
      me in this matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he has done injustice to your indisputable merit,&rdquo; said Hartley,
      dryly, &ldquo;the preference of his daughter has more than atoned for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unquestionably; and dearly, therefore, do I love her; otherwise, Adam, I
      am not a person to grasp at the leavings of other people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; replied Hartley, &ldquo;that pride of yours, if you do not check it,
      will render you both ungrateful and miserable. Mr. Gray's ideas are most
      friendly. He told me plainly that his choice of me as an assistant, and as
      a member of his family, had been a long time balanced by his early
      affection for you, until he thought he had remarked in you a decisive
      discontent with such limited prospects as his offer contained, and a
      desire to go abroad into the world, and push, as it is called, your
      fortune. He said, that although it was very probable that you might love
      his daughter well enough to relinquish these ambitious ideas for her sake,
      yet the demons of Ambition and Avarice would return after the exorciser
      Love had exhausted the force of his spells, and then he thought he would
      have just reason to be anxious for his daughter's happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my faith, the worthy senior speaks scholarly and wisely,&rdquo; answered
      Richard&mdash;&ldquo;I did not think he had been so clear-sighted. To say the
      truth, but for the beautiful Menie Gray, I should feel like a mill-horse,
      walking my daily round in this dull country, while other gay rovers are
      trying how the world will receive them. For instance, where do you
      yourself go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cousin of my mother's commands a ship in the Company's service. I
      intend to go with him as surgeon's mate. If I like the sea service, I will
      continue in it; if not, I will enter some other line.&rdquo; This Hartley said
      with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To India!&rdquo; answered Richard; &ldquo;Happy dog&mdash;to India! You may well bear
      with equanimity all disappointments sustained on this side of the globe.
      Oh, Delhi! oh, Golconda! have your names no power to conjure down idle
      recollections?&mdash;India, where gold is won by steel; where a brave man
      cannot pitch his desire for fame and wealth so high, but that he may
      realize it, if he have fortune to his friend? Is it possible that the bold
      adventurer can fix his thoughts on you, and still be dejected at the
      thoughts that a bonny blue-eyed lass looked favourably on a less lucky
      fellow than himself? Can this be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Less lucky?&rdquo; said Hartley. &ldquo;Can you, the accepted lover of Menie Gray,
      speak in that tone, even though it be in jest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, Adam,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;don't be angry with me, because, being thus
      far successful, I rate my good fortune not quite so rapturously as perhaps
      you do, who have missed the luck of it. Your philosophy should tell you,
      that the object which we attain, or are sure of attaining, loses, perhaps,
      even by that very certainty, a little of the extravagant and ideal value,
      which attached to it while the object of feverish hopes and aguish fears.
      But for all that, I cannot live without my sweet Menie. I would wed her
      to-morrow, with all my soul, without thinking a minute on the clog which
      so early a marriage would fasten on our heels. But to spend two additional
      years in this infernal wilderness, cruising after crowns and half-crowns,
      when worse men are making lacs and crores of rupees&mdash;It is a sad
      falling off, Adam. Counsel me, my friend,&mdash;can you not suggest some
      mode of getting off from these two years of destined dulness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; replied Hartley, scarce repressing his displeasure; &ldquo;and if I
      could induce Dr. Gray to dispense with so reasonable a condition, I should
      be very sorry to do so. You are but twenty-one, and if such a period of
      probation was, in the Doctor's prudence, judged necessary for me, who am
      full two years older, I have no idea that he will dispense with it in
      yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; replied Middlemas; &ldquo;but do you not think that these two, or
      call them three, years of probation, had better be spent in India, where
      much may be done in a little while, than here, where nothing can be done
      save just enough to get salt to our broth, or broth to our salt? Methinks
      I have a natural turn for India, and so I ought. My father was a soldier,
      by the conjecture of all who saw him, and gave me a love of the sword, and
      an arm to use one. My mother's father was a rich trafficker, who loved
      wealth, I warrant me, and knew how to get it. This petty two hundred
      a-year, with its miserable and precarious possibilities, to be shared with
      the old gentleman, sounds in the ears of one like me, who have the world
      for the winning, and a sword to cut my way through it, like something
      little better than a decent kind of beggary. Menie is in herself a gem&mdash;a
      diamond&mdash;I admit it. But then, one would not set such a precious
      jewel in lead or popper, but in pure gold; ay, and add a circlet of
      brilliants to set it off with. Be a good fellow, Adam, and undertake the
      setting my project in proper colours before the Doctor. I am sure, the
      wisest thing for him and Menie both, is to permit me to spend this short
      time of probation in the land of cowries. I am sure my heart will be there
      at any rate, and while I am bleeding some bumpkin for an inflammation, I
      shall be in fancy relieving some nabob, or rajahpoot, of his plethora of
      wealth. Come&mdash;will you assist, will you be auxiliary? Ten chances but
      you plead your own cause, man, for I may be brought up by a sabre, or a
      bow-string, before I make my pack up; then your road to Menie will be free
      and open, and, as you will be possessed of the situation of comforter <i>ex
      officio</i>, you may take her 'with the tear in her ee,' as old saws
      advise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Richard Middlemas,&rdquo; said Hartley, &ldquo;I wish it were possible for me to
      tell you, in the few words which I intend to bestow on you, whether I pity
      you or despise you, the most. Heaven has placed happiness, competence, and
      content within your power, and you are willing to cast them away, to
      gratify ambition and avarice. Were I to give any advice on this subject
      either to Dr. Gray or his daughter, it would be to break of all connexion
      with a man, who, however clever by nature, may soon show himself a fool,
      and however honestly brought up, may also, upon temptation, prove himself
      a villain.&mdash;You may lay aside the sneer, which is designed to be a
      sarcastic smile. I will not attempt to do this, because I am convinced
      that my advice would be of no use, unless it could come unattended with
      suspicion of my motives. I will hasten my departure from this house, that
      we may not meet again; and I will leave it to God Almighty to protect
      honesty and innocence against the dangers which must attend vanity and
      folly.&rdquo; So saying, he turned contemptuously from the youthful votary of
      ambition, and left the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said Middlemas, struck with the picture which had been held up to
      his conscience&mdash;&ldquo;Stop, Adam Hartley, and I will confess to you&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;But
      his words were uttered in a faint and hesitating manner, and either never
      reached Hartley's ear, or failed in changing his purpose of departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was out of the garden, Middlemas began to recall his usual
      boldness of disposition&mdash;&ldquo;Had he staid a moment longer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
      would have turned Papist, and made him my ghostly confessor. The yeomanly
      churl!&mdash;I would give something to know how he has got such a hank
      over me. What are Menie Gray's engagements to him? She has given him his
      answer, and what right has he to come betwixt her and me? If old Moncada
      had done a grandfather's duty, and made suitable settlements on me, this
      plan of marrying the sweet girl, and settling here in her native place,
      might have done well enough. But to live the life of the poor drudge her
      father&mdash;to be at the command and call of every boor for twenty miles
      round!&mdash;why, the labours of a higgler, who travels scores of miles to
      barter pins, ribbons, snuff and tobacco, against the housewife's private
      stock of eggs, mort-skins, and tallow, is more profitable, less laborious,
      and faith I think, equally respectable. No, no,&mdash;unless I can find
      wealth nearer home, I will seek it where every one can have it for the
      gathering; and so I will down to the Swan Inn, and hold a final
      consultation with my friend.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER THE FIFTH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The friend whom Middlemas expected to meet at the Swan, was a person
      already mentioned in this history by the name of Tom Hillary, bred an
      attorney's clerk in the ancient town of Novum Castrum&mdash;<i>doctus
      utriusque juris</i>, as far as a few months in the service of Mr. Lawford,
      Town-clerk of Middlemas, could render him so. The last mention that we
      made of this gentleman, was when his gold-laced hat veiled its splendour
      before the fresher mounted beavers of the 'prentices of Dr. Gray. That was
      now about five years since, and it was within six months that he had made
      his appearance in Middlemas, a very different sort of personage from that
      which he seemed at his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now called Captain; his dress was regimental, and his language
      martial. He appeared to have plenty of cash, for he not only, to the great
      surprise of the parties, paid certain old debts, which he had left
      unsettled behind him, and that notwithstanding his having, as his old
      practice told him, a good defence of prescription, but even sent the
      minister a guinea, to the assistance of the parish poor. These acts of
      justice and benevolence were bruited abroad greatly to the honour of one,
      who, so long absent, had neither forgotten his just debts, nor hardened
      his heart against the cries of the needy. His merits were thought the
      higher, when it was understood he had served the Honourable East India
      Company&mdash;that wonderful company of merchants, who may indeed, with
      the strictest propriety, be termed princes. It was about the middle of the
      eighteenth century, and the directors in Leadenhall Street were silently
      laying the foundation of that immense empire, which afterwards rose like
      an exhalation, and now astonishes Europe, as well as Asia, with its
      formidable extent, and stupendous strength. Britain had now begun to lend
      a wondering ear to the account of battles fought, and cities won, in the
      East; and was surprised by the return of individuals who had left their
      native country as adventurers, but now reappeared there surrounded by
      Oriental wealth and Oriental luxury, which dimmed even the splendour of
      the most wealthy of the British nobility. In this new-found El Dorada,
      Hillary had, it seems, been a labourer, and, if he told truth, to some
      purpose, though he was far from having completed the harvest which he
      meditated. He spoke, indeed, of making investments, and, as a mere matter
      of fancy, he consulted his old master, Clerk Lawford, concerning the
      purchase of a moorland farm of three thousand acres, for which he would be
      content to give three or four thousand guineas, providing the game was
      plenty, and the trouting in the brook such as had been represented by
      advertisement. But he did not wish to make any extensive landed purchase
      at present. It was necessary to keep up his interest in Leadenhall Street;
      and in that view, it would be impolitic to part with his India stock and
      India bonds. In short, it was folly to think of settling on a poor
      thousand or twelve hundred a year, when one was in the prime of life, and
      had no liver complaint; and so he was determined to double the Cape once
      again, ere he retired to the chimney corner for life. All he wished was,
      to pick up a few clever fellows for his regiment, or rather for his own
      company; and as in all his travels he had never seen finer fellows than
      about Middlemas, he was willing to give them the preference in completing
      his levy. In fact, it was making men of them at once, for a few white
      faces never failed to strike terror into these black rascals; and then,
      not to mention the good things that were going at the storming of a
      Pettah, or the plundering of a Pagoda, most of these tawny dogs carried so
      much treasure about their persons, that a won battle was equal to a mine
      of gold to the victors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The natives of Middlemas listened to the noble Captain's marvels with
      different feelings, as their temperaments were saturnine or sanguine. But
      none could deny that such things had been; and, as the narrator was known
      to be a bold dashing fellow, possessed of some abilities, and according to
      the general opinion, not likely to be withheld by any peculiar scruples of
      conscience, there was no giving any good reason why Hillary should not
      have been as successful as others in the field, which India, agitated as
      it was by war and intestine disorders, seemed to offer to every
      enterprising adventurer. He was accordingly received by his old
      acquaintances at Middlemas rather with the respect due to his supposed
      wealth, than in a manner corresponding with his former humble pretensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the notables of the village did indeed keep aloof. Among these,
      the chief was Dr. Gray, who was an enemy to every thing that approached to
      fanfaronade, and knew enough of the world to lay it down as a sort of
      general rule, that he who talks a great deal of fighting is seldom a brave
      soldier, and he who always speaks about wealth is seldom a rich man at
      bottom. Clerk Lawford was also shy, notwithstanding his <i>communings</i>
      with Hillary upon the subject of his intended purchase. The coolness of
      the Captain's old employer towards him was by some supposed to arise out
      of certain circumstances attending their former connexion; but as the
      Clerk himself never explained what these were, it is unnecessary to make
      any conjectures upon the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard Middlemas very naturally renewed his intimacy with his former
      comrade, and it was from Hillary's conversation, that he had adopted the
      enthusiasm respecting India, which we have heard him express. It was
      indeed impossible for a youth, at once inexperienced in the world, and
      possessed of a most sanguine disposition, to listen without sympathy to
      the glowing descriptions of Hillary, who, though only a recruiting
      captain, had all the eloquence of a recruiting sergeant. Palaces rose like
      mushrooms in his descriptions; groves of lofty trees, and aromatic shrubs
      unknown to the chilly soils of Europe, were tenanted by every object of
      the chase, from the royal tiger down to the jackal. The luxuries of a
      natch, and the peculiar Oriental beauty of the enchantresses who perfumed
      their voluptuous Eastern domes, for the pleasure of the haughty English
      conquerors, were no less attractive than the battles and sieges on which
      the Captain at other times expatiated. Not a stream did he mention but
      flowed over sands of gold, and not a palace that was inferior to those of
      the celebrated Fata Morgana. His descriptions seemed steeped in odours,
      and his every phrase perfumed in ottar of roses. The interviews at which
      these descriptions took place, often ended in a bottle of choicer wine
      than the Swan Inn afforded, with some other appendages of the table, which
      the Captain, who was a <i>bon-vivant</i>, had procured from Edinburgh.
      From this good cheer Middlemas was doomed to retire to the homely evening
      meal of his master, where not all the simple beauties of Menie were able
      to overcome his disgust at the coarseness of the provisions, or his
      unwillingness to answer questions concerning the diseases of the wretched
      peasants who were subjected to his inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard's hopes of being acknowledged by his father had long since
      vanished, and the rough repulse and subsequent neglect on the part of
      Moncada, had satisfied him that his grandfather was inexorable, and that
      neither then, nor at any future time, did he mean to realize the visions
      which Nurse Jamieson's splendid figments had encouraged him to entertain.
      Ambition, however, was not lulled to sleep, though it was no longer
      nourished by the same hopes which had at first awakened it. The Indian
      Captain's lavish oratory supplied the themes which had been at first
      derived from the legends of the nursery; the exploits of a Lawrence and a
      Clive, as well as the magnificent opportunities of acquiring wealth to
      which these exploits opened the road, disturbed the slumbers of the young
      adventurer. There was nothing to counteract these except his love for
      Menie Gray, and the engagements into which it had led him. But his
      addresses had been paid to Menie as much for the gratification of his
      vanity, as from any decided passion for that innocent and guileless being.
      He was desirous of carrying off the prize, for which Hartley, whom he
      never loved, had the courage to contend with him. Then Menie Gray had been
      beheld with admiration by men his superiors in rank and fortune, but with
      whom his ambition incited him to dispute the prize. No doubt, though urged
      to play the gallant at first rather from vanity than any other cause, the
      frankness and modesty with which his suit was admitted, made their natural
      impression on his heart. He was grateful to the beautiful creature, who
      acknowledged the superiority of his person and accomplishments, and
      fancied himself as devotedly attached to her, as her personal charms and
      mental merits would have rendered any one who was less vain or selfish
      than her lover. Still his passion for the surgeon's daughter ought not, he
      prudentially determined, to bear more than its due weight in a case so
      very important as the determining his line of life; and this he smoothed
      over to his conscience, by repeating to himself, that Menie's interest was
      as essentially concerned as his own, in postponing their marriage to the
      establishment of his fortune. How many young couples had been ruined by a
      premature union!
    </p>
    <p>
      The contemptuous conduct of Hartley in their last interview, had done
      something to shake his comrade's confidence in the truth of this
      reasoning, and to lead him to suspect that he was playing a very sordid
      and unmanly part, in trifling with the happiness of this amiable and
      unfortunate young woman. It was in this doubtful humour that he repaired
      to the Swan Inn, where he was anxiously expected by his friend the
      Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were comfortably seated over a bottle of Paxarete, Middlemas
      began, with characteristical caution, to sound his friend about the ease
      or difficulty with which an individual, desirous of entering the Company's
      service, might have an opportunity of getting a commission. If Hillary had
      answered truly, he would have replied, that it was extremely easy; for, at
      that time, the East India service presented no charms to that superior
      class of people who have since struggled for admittance under its banners.
      But the worthy Captain replied, that though, in the general case, it might
      be difficult for a young man to obtain a commission, without serving for
      some years as a cadet, yet, under his own protection, a young man entering
      his regiment, and fitted for such a situation, might be sure of an
      ensigncy, if not a lieutenancy, as soon as ever they set foot in India.
      &ldquo;If you, my dear fellow,&rdquo; continued he, extending his hand to Middlemas,
      &ldquo;would think of changing sheep-head broth and haggis for mulagatawny and
      curry, I can only say, that though it is indispensable that you should
      enter the service at first simply as a cadet, yet, by&mdash;&mdash;; you
      should live like a brother on the passage with me; and no sooner were we
      through the surf at Madras, than I would put you in the way of acquiring
      both wealth and glory. You have, I think, some trifle of money&mdash;a
      couple of thousands or so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About a thousand or twelve hundred,&rdquo; said Richard, affecting the
      indifference of his companion, but feeling privately humbled by the
      scantiness of his resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite as much as you will find necessary for the outfit and
      passage,&rdquo; said his adviser; &ldquo;and, indeed, if you had not a farthing, it
      would be the same thing; for if I once say to a friend, I'll help you, Tom
      Hillary is not the man to start for fear of the cowries. However, it is as
      well you have something of a capital of your own to begin upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the proselyte. &ldquo;I should not like to be a burden on any
      one. I have some thoughts, to tell you the truth, to marry before I leave
      Britain; and in that case, you know, cash will be necessary, whether my
      wife goes out with us, or remains behind, till she hear how luck goes with
      me. So, after all, I may have to borrow a few hundreds of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil is that you say, Dick, about marrying and giving in
      marriage?&rdquo; replied his friend. &ldquo;What can put it into the head of a gallant
      young fellow like you, just rising twenty-one, and six feet high on your
      stocking-soles, to make a slave of yourself for life? No, no, Dick, that
      will never do. Remember the old song,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'Bachelor Bluff, bachelor Bluff,
    Hey for a heart that is rugged and tough!'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, that sounds very well,&rdquo; replied Middlemas; &ldquo;but then one must
      shake off a number of old recollections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sooner the better, Dick; old recollections are like old clothes, and
      should be sent off by wholesale; they only take up room in one's wardrobe,
      and it would be old-fashioned to wear them. But you look grave upon it.
      Who the devil is it that has made such a hole in your heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; answered Middlemas, &ldquo;I'm sure you must remember&mdash;Menie&mdash;my
      master's daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Miss Green, the old pottercarrier's daughter?&mdash;a likely girl
      enough, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My master is a surgeon,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;not an apothecary, and his name
      is Gray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, Green or Gray&mdash;what does it signify? He sells his own drugs,
      I think, which we in the south call being a pottercarrier. The girl is a
      likely girl enough for a Scottish ball-room. But is she up to any thing?
      Has she any <i>nouz?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, she is a sensible girl, save in loving me,&rdquo; answered Richard; &ldquo;and
      that, as Benedict says, is no proof of her wisdom, and no great argument
      of her folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But has she spirit&mdash;spunk&mdash;dash&mdash;a spice of the devil
      about her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a penny-weight&mdash;the kindest, simplest, and most manageable of
      human beings,&rdquo; answered the lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won't do then,&rdquo; said the monitor, in a decisive tone. &ldquo;I am sorry for
      it, Dick: but she will never do. There are some women in the world that
      can bear their share in the bustling life we live in India&mdash;ay, and I
      have known some of them drag forward husbands that would otherwise have
      stuck fast in the mud till the day of judgment. Heaven knows how they paid
      the turnpikes they pushed them through! But these were none of your simple
      Susans, that think their eyes are good for nothing but to look at their
      husbands, or their fingers but to sew baby-clothes. Depend on it, you must
      give up your matrimony, or your views of preferment. If you wilfully tie a
      clog round your throat, never think of running a race; but do not suppose
      that your breaking off with the lass will make any very terrible
      catastrophe. A scene there may be at parting; but you will soon forget her
      among the native girls, and she will fall in love with Mr. Tapeitout, the
      minister's assistant and successor. She is not goods for the Indian
      market, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Among the capricious weaknesses of humanity, that one is particularly
      remarkable which inclines us to esteem persons and things not by their
      real value, or even by our own judgment, so much as by the opinion of
      others, who are often very incompetent judges. Dick Middlemas had been
      urged forward, in his suit to Menie Gray, by his observing how much her
      partner, a booby laird, had been captivated by her; and she was now
      lowered in his esteem, because an impudent low-lived coxcomb had presumed
      to talk of her with disparagement. Either of these worthy gentlemen would
      have been as capable of enjoying the beauties of Homer, as judging of the
      merits of Menie Gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed the ascendency which this bold-talking, promise-making soldier had
      acquired over Dick Middlemas, wilful as he was in general, was of a
      despotic nature; because the Captain, though greatly inferior in
      information and talent to the youth whose opinions he swayed, had skill in
      suggesting those tempting views of rank and wealth, to which Richard's
      imagination had been from childhood most accessible. One promise he
      exacted from Middlemas, as a condition of the services which he was to
      render him&mdash;It was absolute silence on the subject of his destination
      for India, and the views upon which it took place. &ldquo;My recruits,&rdquo; said the
      Captain, &ldquo;have been all marched off for the depot at the Isle of Wight;
      and I want to leave Scotland, and particularly this little burgh, without
      being worried to death, of which I must despair, should it come to be
      known that I can provide young griffins, as we call them, with
      commissions. Gad, I should carry off all the first-born of Middlemas as
      cadets, and none are so scrupulous as I am about making promises. I am as
      trusty as a Trojan for that; and you know I cannot do that for every one
      which I would for an old friend like Dick Middlemas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick promised secrecy, and it was agreed that the two friends should not
      even leave the burgh in company, but that the Captain should set off
      first, and his recruit should join him at Edinburgh, where his enlistment
      might be attested; and then they were to travel together to town, and
      arrange matters for their Indian voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the definitive arrangement which was thus made for his
      departure, Middlemas thought from time to time with anxiety and regret
      about quitting Menie Gray, after the engagement which had passed between
      them. The resolution was taken, however; the blow was necessarily to be
      struck; and her ungrateful lover, long since determined against the life
      of domestic happiness, which he might have enjoyed had his views been
      better regulated, was now occupied with the means, not indeed of breaking
      off with her entirely, but of postponing all thoughts of their union until
      the success of his expedition to India.
    </p>
    <p>
      He might have spared himself all anxiety on this last subject. The wealth
      of that India to which he was bound would not have bribed Menie Gray to
      have left her father's roof against her father's commands; still less
      when, deprived of his two assistants, he must be reduced to the necessity
      of continued exertion in his declining life, and therefore might have
      accounted himself altogether deserted, had his daughter departed from him
      at the same time. But though it would have been her unalterable
      determination not to accept any proposal of an immediate union of their
      fortunes, Menie could not, with all a lover's power of self-deception,
      succeed in persuading herself to be satisfied with Richard's conduct
      towards her. Modesty, and a becoming pride, prevented her from seeming to
      notice, but could not prevent her from bitterly feeling, that her lover
      was preferring the pursuits of ambition to the humble lot which he might
      have shared with her, and which promised content at least, if not wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he had loved me as he pretended,&rdquo; such was the unwilling conviction
      that rose on her mind, &ldquo;my father would surely not have ultimately refused
      him the same terms which he held out to Hartley. His objections would have
      given way to my happiness, nay, to Richard's importunities, which would
      have removed his suspicions of the unsettled cast of his disposition. But
      I fear&mdash;I fear Richard hardly thought the terms proposed were worthy
      of his acceptance. Would it not have been natural too, that he should have
      asked me, engaged as we stand to each other, to have united our faith
      before his quitting Europe, when I might either have remained here with my
      father, or accompanied him to India, in quest of that fortune which he is
      so eagerly pushing for? It would have been wrong&mdash;very wrong&mdash;in
      me to have consented to such a proposal, unless my father had authorised
      it; but surely it would have been natural that Richard should have offered
      it? Alas! men do not know how to love like women! Their attachment is only
      one of a thousand other passions and predilections,&mdash;they are daily
      engaged in pleasures which blunt their feelings, and in business which
      distracts them. We&mdash;we sit at home to weep, and to think how coldly
      our affections are repaid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The time was now arrived at which Richard Middlemas had a right to demand
      the property vested in the hands of the Town-clerk and Doctor Gray. He did
      so, and received it accordingly. His late guardian naturally enquired what
      views he had formed in entering on life? The imagination, of the ambitious
      aspirant saw in this simple question a desire, on the part of the worthy
      man, to offer, and perhaps press upon him, the same proposal which he had
      made to Hartley. He hastened, therefore, to answer dryly, that he had some
      hopes held out to him which he was not at liberty to communicate; but that
      the instant he reached London, he would write to the guardian of his
      youth, and acquaint him with the nature of his prospects, which he was
      happy to say were rather of a pleasing character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon, who supposed that at this critical period of his life, the father,
      or grandfather, of the young man might perhaps have intimated a
      disposition to open some intercourse with him, only replied,&mdash;&ldquo;You
      have been the child of mystery, Richard; and as you came to me, so you
      leave me. Then, I was ignorant from whence you came, and now, I know not
      whither you are, going. It is not, perhaps, a very favourable point in
      your horoscope, that every thing connected with you is a secret. But as I
      shall always think with kindness on him whom I have known so long, so when
      you remember the old man, you ought not to forget that he has done his
      duty to you, to the extent of his means and power, and taught you that
      noble profession, by means of which, wherever your lot casts you, you may
      always gain your bread, and alleviate at the same time, the distresses of
      your fellow creatures.&rdquo; Middlemas was excited by the simple kindness of
      his master, and poured forth his thanks with the greater profusion, that
      he was free from the terror of the emblematical collar and chain, which a
      moment before seemed to glisten in the hand of his guardian, and gape to
      enclose his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word more,&rdquo; said Mr. Gray, producing a small ring-case. &ldquo;This
      valuable ring was forced upon me by your unfortunate mother. I have no
      right to it, having been amply paid for my services; and I only accepted
      it with the purpose of keeping it for you till this moment should arrive.
      It may be useful, perhaps, should there occur any question about your
      identity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, once more, my more than father, for this precious relic, which,
      may indeed be useful. You shall be repaid, if India has diamonds left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;India, and diamonds!&rdquo; said Gray. &ldquo;Is your head turned, child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; stammered Middlemas, &ldquo;if London has any Indian diamonds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! you foolish lad,&rdquo; answered Gray, &ldquo;how should you buy diamonds, or
      what should I do with them, if you gave me ever so many? Get you gone with
      you while I am angry.&rdquo;&mdash;The tears were glistening in the old man's
      eyes&mdash;&ldquo;If I get pleased with you again, I shall not know how to part
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The parting of Middlemas with poor Menie was yet more affecting. Her
      sorrow revived in his mind all the liveliness of a first love, and he
      redeemed his character for sincere attachment, by not only imploring an
      instant union, but even going so far as to propose renouncing his more
      splendid prospects, and sharing Mr. Gray's humble toil, if by doing so he
      could secure his daughter's hand. But though there was consolation in this
      testimony of her lover's faith, Menie Gray was not so unwise as to accept
      of sacrifices which might afterwards have been repented of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Richard,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it seldom ends happily when people alter, in a
      moment of agitated feeling, plans which might have been adopted under
      mature deliberation. I have long seen that your views were extended far
      beyond so humble a station as this place affords promise of. It is natural
      they should do so, considering that the circumstances of your birth seemed
      connected with riches and with rank. Go, then, seek that riches and rank.
      It is possible your mind may be changed in the pursuit, and if so, think
      no more about Menie Gray. But if it should be otherwise, we may meet
      again, and do not believe for a moment that there can be a change in Menie
      Gray's feelings towards you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this interview, much more was said than it is necessary to repeat, much
      more thought than was actually said. Nurse Jamieson, in whose chamber it
      took place, folded her <i>bairns</i>, as she called them, in her arms, and
      declared that Heaven had made them for each other, and that she would not
      ask of Heaven to live beyond the day when she should see them bridegroom
      and bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length it became necessary that the parting scene should end; and
      Richard Middlemas, mounting a horse which he had hired for the journey,
      set off for Edinburgh, to which metropolis he had already forwarded his
      heavy baggage. Upon the road the idea more than once occurred to him, that
      even, yet he had better return to Middlemas, and secure his happiness by
      uniting himself at once to Menie Gray, and to humble competence. But from
      the moment that he rejoined his friend Hillary at their appointed place of
      rendezvous, he became ashamed even to hint at any change of purpose; and
      his late excited feelings were forgotten, unless in so far as they
      confirmed his resolution, that as soon as he had attained a certain
      portion of wealth and consequence, he would haste to share them with Menie
      Gray. Yet his gratitude to her father did not appear to have slumbered, if
      we may judge from the gift of a very handsome cornelian seal, set in gold,
      and bearing engraved upon it Gules, a lion rampant within a bordure Or,
      which was carefully despatched to Stevenlaw's Land, Middlemas, with a
      suitable letter. Menie knew the hand-writing and watched her father's
      looks as he read it, thinking, perhaps, that it had turned on a different
      topic. Her father pshawed and poohed a good deal when he had finished the
      billet, and examined the seal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick Middlemas,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is but a fool after all, Menie. I am sure I am
      not like to forget him, that he should send me a token of remembrance; add
      if he would be so absurd, could he not have sent me the improved
      lithotomical apparatus? And what have I, Gideon Gray, to do with the arms
      of my Lord Gray?&mdash;No, no,&mdash;my old silver stamp, with the double
      G upon it, will serve my turn&mdash;But put the bonnie dye [Footnote:
      &ldquo;Pretty Toy&rdquo;] away, Menie, my dear&mdash;it was kindly meant at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reader cannot doubt that the seal was safely and carefully preserved.

      After the Captain had finished his business, amongst which he did not
      forget to have his recruit regularly attested, as a candidate for glory in
      the service of the Honourable East India Company, the friends left
      Edinburgh. From thence they got a passage by sea to Newcastle, where
      Hillary had also some regimental affairs to transact, before he joined his
      regiment. At Newcastle the Captain had the good luck to find a small brig,
      commanded by an old acquaintance and school-fellow, which was just about
      to sail for the Isle of Wight. &ldquo;I have arranged for our passage with him,&rdquo;
       he said to Middlemas&mdash;&ldquo;for when you are at the depot, you can learn a
      little of your duty, which cannot be so well taught on board of ship, and
      then I will find it easier to have you promoted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;that I am to stay at the Isle of Wight all
      the time that you are jigging it away in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, indeed do I,&rdquo; said his comrade, &ldquo;and it's best for you too; whatever
      business you have in London, I can do it for you as well, or something
      better than yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I choose to transact my own business myself, Captain Hillary,' said
      Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you ought to have remained your own master, Mr. Cadet Middlemas. At
      present you are an enlisted recruit of the Honourable East India Company;
      I am your officer, and should you hesitate to follow me aboard, why, you
      foolish fellow, I could have you sent on board in hand-cuffs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was jestingly spoken; but yet there was something in the tone which
      hurt Middlemas's pride and alarmed his fears. He had observed of late,
      that his friend, especially when in company of others, talked to him with
      an air of command or superiority, difficult to be endured, and yet so
      closely allied to the freedom often exercised betwixt two intimates, that
      he could not find any proper mode of rebuffing, or resenting it. Such
      manifestations of authority were usually followed by an instant renewal of
      their intimacy; but in the present case that did not so speedily ensue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Middlemas, indeed, consented to go with his companion to the Isle of
      Wight, perhaps because if he should quarrel with him, the whole plan of
      his Indian voyage, and all the hopes built upon it, must fall to the
      ground. But he altered his purpose of intrusting his comrade with his
      little fortune, to lay out as his occasions might require, and resolved
      himself to overlook the expenditure of his money, which, in the form of
      Bank of England notes, was safely deposited in his travelling trunk.
      Captain Hillary, finding that some hint he had thrown out on this subject
      was disregarded, appeared to think no more about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voyage was performed with safety and celerity; and having coasted the
      shores of that beautiful island, which he who once sees never forgets,
      through whatever part of the world his future path may lead him, the
      vessel was soon anchored off the little town of Ryde; and, as the waves
      were uncommonly still, Richard felt the sickness diminish, which, for a
      considerable part of the passage, had occupied his attention more than any
      thing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master of the brig, in honour to his passengers, and affection to his
      old school-fellow, had formed an awning upon deck, and proposed to have
      the pleasure of giving them a little treat before they left his vessel.
      Lobscous, sea-pie, and other delicacies of a naval description, had been
      provided in a quantity far disproportionate to the number of the guests.
      But the punch which succeeded was of excellent quality, and portentously
      strong. Captain Hillary pushed it round, and insisted upon his companion
      taking his full share in the merry bout, the rather that, as he
      facetiously said, there had been some dryness between them, which good
      liquor would be sovereign in removing. He renewed, with additional
      splendours, the various panoramic scenes of India and Indian adventures,
      which had first excited the ambition of Middlemas, and assured him, that
      even if he should not be able to get him a commission instantly, yet a
      short delay would only give him time to become better acquainted with his
      military duties; and Middlemas was too much elevated by the liquor he had
      drank to see any difficulty which could oppose itself to his fortunes.
      Whether those who shared in the compotation were more seasoned topers&mdash;whether
      Middlemas drank more than they&mdash;or whether, as he himself afterwards
      suspected, his cup had been drugged, like those of King Duncan's
      body-guard, it is certain that, on this occasion, he passed with unusual
      rapidity, through all the different phases of the respectable state of
      drunkenness&mdash;laughed, sung, whooped, and hallooed, was maudlin in his
      fondness, and frantic in his wrath, and at length fell into a fast and
      imperturbable sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of the liquor displayed itself, as usual, in a hundred wild
      dreams of parched deserts, and of serpents whose bite inflicted the most
      intolerable thirst&mdash;of the suffering of the Indian on the death-stake&mdash;and
      the torments of the infernal regions themselves; when at length he
      awakened, and it appeared that the latter vision was in fact realized. The
      sounds which had at first influenced his dreams, and at length broken his
      slumbers, were of the most horrible, as well as the most melancholy
      description. They came from the ranges of pallet-beds, which were closely
      packed together in a species of military hospital, where a burning fever
      was the prevalent complaint. Many of the patients were under the influence
      of a high delirium, during which they shouted, shrieked, laughed,
      blasphemed, and uttered the most horrible imprecations. Others, sensible
      of their condition, bewailed it with low groans, and some attempts at
      devotion, which showed their ignorance of the principles, and even the
      forms of religion. Those who were convalescent talked ribaldry in a loud
      tone, or whispered to each other in cant language, upon schemes which, as
      far as a passing phrase could be understood by a novice, had relation to
      violent and criminal exploits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard Middlemas's astonishment was equal to his horror. He had but one
      advantage over the poor wretches with whom he was classed, and it was in
      enjoying the luxury of a pallet to himself&mdash;most of the others being
      occupied by two unhappy beings. He saw no one who appeared to attend to
      the wants, or to heed the complaints, of the wretches around him, or to
      whom he could offer any appeal against his present situation. He looked
      for his clothes, that he might arise and extricate himself from this den
      of horrors; but his clothes were nowhere to be seen, nor did he see his
      portmanteau, or sea-chest. It was much to be apprehended he would never
      see them more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, but too late, he remembered the insinuations which had passed
      current respecting his friend the Captain, who was supposed to have been
      discharged by Mr. Lawford, on account of some breach of trust in the
      Town-Clerk's service. But that he should have trepanned the friend who had
      reposed his whole confidence in him&mdash;that he should have plundered
      him of his fortune, and placed him in this house of pestilence, with the
      hope that death might stifle his tongue&mdash;were iniquities not to have
      been, anticipated, even if the worst of these reports were true.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Middlemas resolved not to be awanting to himself. This place must be
      visited by some officer, military or medical, to whom he would make an
      appeal, and alarm his fears at least, if he could not awaken his
      conscience. While he revolved these distracting thoughts, tormented at the
      same time by a burning thirst which he had no means of satisfying, he
      endeavoured to discover if, amongst those stretched upon the pallets
      nearest him, he could not discern some one likely to enter into
      conversation with him, and give him some information about the nature and
      customs of this horrid place. But the bed nearest him was occupied by two
      fellows, who, although to judge from their gaunt cheeks, hollow eyes, and
      ghastly looks, they were apparently recovering from the disease, and just
      rescued from the jaws of death, were deeply engaged in endeavouring to
      cheat each other of a few half-pence at a game of cribbage, mixing the
      terms of the game with oaths not loud but deep; each turn of luck being
      hailed by the winner as well as the loser with execrations, which seemed
      designed to blight both body and soul, now used as the language of
      triumph, and now as reproaches against fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next to the gamblers was a pallet, occupied indeed by two bodies, but only
      one of which was living&mdash;the other sufferer had been recently
      relieved from his agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dead&mdash;he is dead!&rdquo; said the wretched survivor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do you die too, and be d&mdash;d,&rdquo; answered one of the players, &ldquo;and
      then there will be a pair of you, as Pugg says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you he is growing stiff and cold,&rdquo; said the poor wretch&mdash;&ldquo;the
      dead is no bed-fellow for the living&mdash;For God's sake help to rid me
      of the corpse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and get the credit of having <i>done</i> him&mdash;as may be the case
      with, yourself, friend&mdash;for he had some two or three hoggs about him&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know you took the last rap from his breeches-pocket not an hour ago,&rdquo;
       expostulated the poor convalescent&mdash;&ldquo;But help me to take the body out
      of the bed, and I will not tell the <i>jigger-dubber</i> that you have
      been beforehand with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tell the <i>jigger-dubber!</i>&rdquo; answered the cribbage player. &ldquo;Such
      another word, and I will twist your head round till your eyes look at the
      drummer's handwriting on your back. Hold your peace, and don't bother our
      game with your gammon, or I will make you as mute as your bedfellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unhappy wretch, exhausted, sunk back beside his hideous companion, and
      the usual jargon of the game, interlarded with execrations, went on as
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this specimen of the most obdurate indifference, contrasted with the
      last excess of misery, Middlemas became satisfied how little could be made
      of an appeal to the humanity of his fellow-sufferers. His heart sunk
      within him, and the thoughts of the happy and peaceful home, which he
      might have called his own, rose before his over-heated fancy, with a
      vividness of perception that bordered upon insanity. He saw before him the
      rivulet which wanders through the burgh-muir of Middlemas, where he had so
      often set little mills for the amusement of Menie while she was a child.
      One draught of it would have been worth all the diamonds of the East,
      which of late he had worshipped with such devotion; but that draught was
      denied to him as to Tantalus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rallying his senses from this passing illusion, and knowing enough of the
      practice of the medical art, to be aware of the necessity of preventing
      his ideas from wandering if possible, he endeavoured to recollect that he
      was a surgeon, and, after all, should not have the extreme fear for the
      interior of a military hospital, which its horrors might inspire into
      strangers to the profession. But though he strove, by such recollections,
      to rally his spirits, he was not the less aware of the difference betwixt
      the condition of a surgeon, who might have attended such a place in the
      course of his duty, and a poor inhabitant, who was at once a patient and a
      prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      A footstep was now heard in the apartment, which seemed to silence all the
      varied sounds of woe that filled it. The cribbage party hid their cards,
      and ceased their oaths; other wretches, whose complaints had arisen to
      frenzy, left off their wild exclamations and entreaties for assistance.
      Agony softened her shriek, Insanity hushed its senseless clamours, and
      even Death seemed desirous to stifle his parting groan in the presence of
      Captain Seelencooper. This official was the superintendent, or, as the
      miserable inhabitants termed him, the Governor of the Hospital. He had all
      the air of having been originally a turnkey in some ill-regulated jail&mdash;a
      stout, short, bandy-legged man, with one eye, and a double portion of
      ferocity in that which remained. He wore an old-fashioned tarnished
      uniform, which did not seem to have been made for him; and the voice in
      which this minister of humanity addressed the sick, was that of a
      boatswain, shouting in the midst of a storm. He had pistols and a cutlass
      in his belt; for his mode of administration being such as provoked even
      hospital patients to revolt, his life had been more than once in danger
      amongst them. He was followed by two assistants, who carried hand-cuffs
      and strait-jackets.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Seelencooper made his rounds, complaint and pain were hushed, and the
      flourish of the bamboo, which he bore in his hand, seemed powerful as the
      wand of a magician to silence all complaint and remonstrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you the meat is as sweet as a nosegay&mdash;and for the bread,
      it's good enough, and too good, for a set of lubbers, that lie shamming
      Abraham, and consuming the Right Honourable Company's victuals&mdash;I
      don't speak to them that are really sick, for God knows I am always for
      humanity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that be the case, sir,&rdquo; said Richard Middlemas, whose lair the Captain
      had approached, while he was thus answering the low and humble complaints
      of those by whose bed-side he passed&mdash;&ldquo;if that be the case, sir, I
      hope your humanity will make you attend to what I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;who the devil are you?&rdquo; said the Governor, turning on him his
      single eye of fire, while a sneer gathered on his harsh features, which
      were so well qualified to express it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Middlemas&mdash;I come from Scotland, and have been sent here
      by some strange mistake. I am neither a private soldier, nor am I
      indisposed, more than by the heat of this cursed place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why then, friend, all I have to ask you is, whether you are an attested
      recruit or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was attested at Edinburgh,&rdquo; said Middlemas, &ldquo;but&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what the devil would you have then?&mdash;you are enlisted&mdash;the
      Captain and the Doctor sent you here&mdash;surely they know best whether
      you are private or officer, sick or well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I was promised,&rdquo; said Middlemas, &ldquo;promised by Tom Hillary&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promised, were you? Why, there is not a man here that has not been
      promised something by somebody or another, or perhaps has promised
      something to himself. This is the land of promise, my smart fellow, but
      you know it is India that must be the land of performance. So, good
      morning to you. The Doctor will come his rounds presently and put you all
      to rights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay but one moment&mdash;one moment only&mdash;I have been robbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robbed! look you there now,&rdquo; said the Governor&mdash;&ldquo;everybody that
      comes here has been robbed.&mdash;Egad, I am the luckiest fellow in Europe&mdash;other
      people in my line have only thieves and blackguards upon their hands; but
      none come to my ken but honest, decent, unfortunate gentlemen, that have
      been robbed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care how you treat this so lightly, sir,&rdquo; said Middlemas; &ldquo;I have
      been robbed of a thousand pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Governor Seelencooper's gravity was totally overcome, and his laugh
      was echoed by several of the patients, either because they wished to curry
      favour with the superintendent, or from the feeling which influences evil
      spirits to rejoice in the tortures of those who are sent to share their
      agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand pounds!&rdquo; exclaimed Captain Seelencooper, as he recovered his
      breath,&mdash;&ldquo;Come, that's a good one&mdash;I like a fellow that does not
      make two bites of a cherry&mdash;why, there is not a cull in the ken that
      pretends to have lost more than a few hoggs, and here is a servant to the
      Honourable Company that has been robbed of a thousand pounds! Well done,
      Mr. Tom of Ten Thousand-you're a credit to the house, and to the service,
      and so good morning to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He passed on, and Richard, starting up in a storm of anger and despair,
      found, as he would have called after him, that his voice, betwixt thirst
      and agitation, refused its office. &ldquo;Water, water!&rdquo; he said, laying hold,
      at the same time, of one of the assistants who followed Seelencooper by
      the sleeve. The fellow looked carelessly round; there was a jug stood by
      the side of the cribbage players, which he reached to Middlemas, bidding
      him, &ldquo;Drink and be d&mdash;&mdash;d.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man's back was no sooner turned, than the gamester threw himself from
      his own bed into that of Middlemas, and grasping firm hold of the arm of
      Richard, ere he could carry the vessel to his head, swore he should not
      have his booze. It may be readily conjectured, that the pitcher thus
      anxiously and desperately reclaimed, contained something better than the
      pure element. In fact, a large proportion of it was gin. The jug was
      broken in the struggle, and the liquor spilt. Middlemas dealt a blow to
      the assailant, which was amply and heartily repaid, and a combat would
      have ensued, but for the interference of the superintendent and his
      assistants, who, with a dexterity that showed them well acquainted with
      such emergencies, clapped a straight-waistcoat upon each of the
      antagonists. Richard's efforts at remonstrance only procured him a blow
      from Captain Seelencooper's rattan, and a tender admonition to hold his
      tongue, if he valued a whole skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irritated at once by sufferings of the mind and of the body, tormented by
      raging thirst, and by the sense of his own dreadful situation, the mind of
      Richard Middlemas seemed to be on the point of becoming unsettled. He felt
      an insane desire to imitate and reply to the groans, oaths, and ribaldry,
      which, as soon as the superintendent quitted the hospital, echoed around
      him. He longed, though he struggled against the impulse, to vie in curses
      with the reprobate, and in screams with the maniac. But his tongue clove
      to the roof of his mouth, his mouth itself seemed choked with ashes; there
      came upon him a dimness of sight, a rushing sound in his ears, and the
      powers of life were for a time suspended.

      CHAPTER THE SEVENTH.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  A wise physician, skill'd our wounds to heal,
  Is more than armies to the common weal.
                                POPE'S <i>Homer</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      As Middlemas returned to his senses, he was sensible that his blood felt
      more cool; that the feverish throb of his pulsation was diminished; that
      the ligatures on his person were removed, and his lungs performed their
      functions more freely. One assistant was binding up a vein, from which a
      considerable quantity of blood had been taken; another, who had just
      washed the face of the patient, was holding aromatic vinegar to his
      nostrils. As he began to open his eyes, the person who had just completed
      the bandage, said in Latin, but in a very low tone, and without raising
      his head, &ldquo;Annon sis Ricardus ille Middlemas, ex civitate Middlemassiense?
      Responde in lingua Latina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sum ille miserrimus,&rdquo; replied Richard, again shutting his eyes; for,
      strange as it may seem, the voice of his comrade Adam Hartley, though his
      presence might be of so much consequence in this emergency, conveyed a
      pang to his wounded pride. He was conscious of unkindly, if not hostile,
      feelings towards his old companion; he remembered the tone of superiority
      which he used to assume over him, and thus to lie stretched at his feet,
      and in a manner at his mercy, aggravated his distress, by the feelings of
      the dying chieftain, &ldquo;Earl Percy sees my fall.&rdquo; This was, however, too
      unreasonable an emotion to subsist above a minute. In the next, he availed
      himself of the Latin language, with which both were familiar, (for in that
      time the medical studies at the celebrated University of Edinburgh were,
      in a great measure, conducted in Latin,) to tell in a few words his own
      folly, and the villany of Hillary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be gone instantly,&rdquo; said Hartley&mdash;&ldquo;Take courage&mdash;I trust
      to be able to assist you. In the meantime, take food and physic from none
      but my servant, who you see holds the sponge in his hand. You are in a
      place where a man's life has been taken for the sake of his gold
      sleeve-buttons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay yet a moment,&rdquo; said Middlemas&mdash;&ldquo;Let me remove this temptation
      from my dangerous neighbours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew a small packet from his under waistcoat, and put it into Hartley's
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I die,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;be my heir. You deserve her better than I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All answer was prevented by the hoarse voice of Seelencooper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Doctor, will you carry through your patient?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Symptoms are dubious yet,&rdquo; said the Doctor&mdash;&ldquo;That was an alarming
      swoon. You must have him carried into the private ward, and my young man
      shall attend him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, if you command it, Doctor, needs must;&mdash;but I can tell you
      there is a man we both know, that has a thousand reasons at least for
      keeping him in the public ward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing of your thousand reasons,&rdquo; said Hartley; &ldquo;I can only tell
      you that this young fellow is as well-limbed and likely a lad as the
      Company have among their recruits. It is my business to save him for their
      service, and if he dies by your neglecting what I direct, depend upon it I
      will not allow the blame to lie at my door. I will tell the General the
      charge I have given you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The General!&rdquo; said Seelencooper, much embarrassed&mdash;&ldquo;Tell the
      General?&mdash;ay, about his health. But you will not say any thing about
      what he may have said in his light-headed fits? My eyes! if you listen to
      what feverish patients say when the tantivy is in their brain, your back
      will soon break with tale-bearing, for I will warrant you plenty of them
      to carry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Seelencooper,&rdquo; said the Doctor, &ldquo;I do not meddle with your
      department in the hospital; my advice to you is, not to trouble yourself
      with mine. I suppose, as I have a commission in the service, and have
      besides a regular diploma as a physician, I know when my patient is
      light-headed or otherwise. So do you let the man be carefully looked
      after, at your peril.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus saying, he left the hospital, but not till, under pretext of again
      consulting the pulse, he pressed the patient's hand, as if to assure him
      once more of his exertions for his liberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My eyes!&rdquo; muttered Seelencooper, &ldquo;this cockerel crows gallant, to come
      from a Scotch roost; but I would know well enough how to fetch the
      youngster off the perch, if it were not for the cure he has done on the
      General's pickaninies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Enough of this fell on Richard's ear to suggest hopes of deliverance,
      which were increased when he was shortly afterwards removed to a separate
      ward, a place much more decent in appearance, and inhabited only by two
      patients, who seemed petty officers. Although sensible that he had no
      illness, save that weakness which succeeds violent agitation, he deemed it
      wisest to suffer himself still to be treated as a patient, in
      consideration that he should thus remain under his comrade's
      superintendence. Yet while preparing to avail himself of Hartley's good
      offices, the prevailing reflection of his secret bosom was the ungrateful
      sentiment, &ldquo;Had Heaven no other means of saving me than by the hands of
      him I like least on the face of the earth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, ignorant of the ungrateful sentiments of his comrade, and
      indeed wholly indifferent how he felt towards him, Hartley proceeded in
      doing him such service as was in his power, without any other object than
      the discharge of his own duty as a man and as a Christian. The manner in
      which he became qualified to render his comrade assistance, requires some
      short explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our story took place at a period, when the Directors of the East India
      Company, with that hardy and persevering policy which has raised to such a
      height the British Empire in the East, had determined to send a large
      reinforcement of European troops to the support of their power in India,
      then threatened by the kingdom of Mysore, of which the celebrated Hyder
      Ali had usurped the government, after dethroning his master. Considerable
      difficulty was found in obtaining recruits for that service. Those who
      might have been otherwise disposed to be soldiers, were afraid of the
      climate, and of the species of banishment which the engagement implied;
      and doubted also how far the engagements of the Company might be
      faithfully observed towards them, when they were removed from the
      protection of the British laws. For these and other reasons, the military
      service of the King was preferred, and that of the Company could only
      procure the worst recruits, although their zealous agents scrupled not to
      employ the worst means. Indeed the practice of kidnapping, or crimping, as
      it is technically called, was at that time general, whether for the
      colonies, or even for the King's troops; and as the agents employed in
      such transactions must be of course entirely unscrupulous, there was not
      only much villany committed in the direct prosecution of the trade, but it
      gave rise incidentally to remarkable cases of robbery, and even murder.
      Such atrocities were of course concealed from the authorities for whom the
      levies were made, and the necessity of obtaining soldiers made men, whose
      conduct was otherwise unexceptionable, cold in looking closely into the
      mode in which their recruiting service was conducted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal depot of the troops which were by these means assembled, was
      in the Isle of Wight, where the season proving unhealthy, and the men
      themselves being many of them of a bad habit of body, a fever of a
      malignant character broke out amongst them, and speedily crowded with
      patients the military hospital, of which Mr. Seelencooper, himself an old
      and experienced crimp and kidnapper, had obtained the superintendence.
      Irregularities began to take place also among the soldiers who remained
      healthy, and the necessity of subjecting them to some discipline before
      they sailed was so evident, that several officers of the Company's naval
      service expressed their belief that otherwise there would be dangerous
      mutinies on the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      To remedy the first of these evils, the Court of Directors sent down to
      the island several of their medical servants, amongst whom was Hartley,
      whose qualifications had been amply certified by a medical board, before
      which he had passed an examination, besides his possessing a diploma from
      the University of Edinburgh as M. D.
    </p>
    <p>
      To enforce the discipline of their soldiers, the Court committed full
      power to one of their own body, General Witherington. The General was an
      officer who had distinguished himself highly in their service. He had
      returned from India five or six years before, with a large fortune, which
      he had rendered much greater by an advantageous marriage with a rich
      heiress. The General and his lady went little into society, but seemed to
      live entirely for their infant family, those in number being three, two
      boys and a girl. Although he had retired from the service, he willingly
      undertook the temporary charge committed to him, and taking a house at a
      considerable distance from the town of Ryde, he proceeded to enrol the
      troops into separate bodies, appoint officers of capacity to each, and by
      regular training and discipline, gradually to bring them into something
      resembling good order. He heard their complaints of ill usage in the
      articles of provisions and appointments, and did them upon all occasions
      the strictest justice, save that he was never known to restore one recruit
      to his freedom from the service, however unfairly or even illegally his
      attestation might have been obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is none of my business,&rdquo; said General Witherington, &ldquo;how you became
      soldiers,&mdash;soldiers I found you, and soldiers I will leave you. But I
      will take especial care, that as soldiers you shall have every thing, to a
      penny or a pin's head, that you are justly entitled to.&rdquo; He went to work
      without fear or favour, reported many abuses to the Board of Directors,
      had several officers, commissaries, &amp;c. removed from the service, and
      made his name as great a terror to the peculators at home, as it had been
      to the enemies of Britain in Hindostan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Seelencooper, and his associates in the hospital department, heard
      and trembled, fearing that their turn should come next; but the General,
      who elsewhere examined all with his own eyes, showed a reluctance to visit
      the hospital in person. Public report industriously imputed this to fear
      of infection. Such was certainly the motive; though it was not fear for
      his own safety that influenced General Witherington, but he dreaded lest
      he should carry the infection home to the nursery, on which he doated. The
      alarm of his lady was yet more unreasonably sensitive: she would scarcely
      suffer the children to walk abroad, if the wind but blew from the quarter
      where the hospital was situated.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Providence baffles the precautions of mortals. In a walk across the
      fields, chosen as the most sheltered and sequestered, the children, with
      their train of Eastern and European attendants, met a woman who carried a
      child that was recovering from the small-pox. The anxiety of the father,
      joined to some religious scruples on the mother's part, had postponed
      inoculation, which was then scarcely come into general use. The infection
      caught like a quick-match, and ran like wildfire through all those in the
      family who had not previously had the disease. One of the General's
      children, the second boy, died, and two of the Ayas, or black female
      servants, had the same fate. The hearts of the father and mother would
      have been broken for the child they had lost, had not their grief been
      suspended by anxiety for the fate of those who lived, and who were
      confessed to be in imminent danger. They were like persons distracted, as
      the symptoms of the poor patients appeared gradually to resemble more
      nearly that of the child already lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the parents were in this agony of apprehension, the General's
      principal servant, a native of Northumberland like himself, informed him
      one morning that there was a young man from the same county among the
      hospital doctors, who had publicly blamed the mode of treatment observed
      towards the patients, and spoken of another which he had seen practised
      with eminent success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some impudent quack,&rdquo; said the General, &ldquo;who would force himself into
      business by bold assertions. Doctor Tourniquet and Doctor Lancelot are men
      of high reputation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not mention their reputation,&rdquo; said the mother, with a mother's
      impatience, &ldquo;did they not let my sweet Reuben die? What avails the
      reputation of the physician, when the patient perisheth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If his honour would but see Doctor Hartley,&rdquo; said Winter, turning half
      towards the lady, then turning back again to his master. &ldquo;He is a very
      decent young man, who, I am sure, never expected what he said to reach
      your honour's ears;&mdash;and he is a native of Northumberland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send a servant with a led horse,&rdquo; said the General; &ldquo;let the young man
      come hither instantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is well known, that the ancient mode of treating the small-pox was to
      refuse to the patient every thing which Nature urged him to desire; and,
      in particular, to confine him to heated rooms, beds loaded with blankets,
      and spiced wine, when Nature called for cold water and fresh air. A
      different mode of treatment had of late been adventured upon by some
      practitioners, who preferred reason to authority, and Gideon Gray had
      followed it for several years with extraordinary success.
    </p>
    <p>
      When General Witherington saw Hartley, he was startled at his youth; but
      when he heard him modestly, but with confidence, state the difference of
      the two modes of treatment, and the rationale of his practice, he listened
      with the most serious attention. So did his lady, her streaming eyes
      turning from Hartley to her husband, as if to watch what impression the
      arguments of the former were making upon the latter. General Witherington
      was silent for a few minutes after Hartley had finished his exposition,
      and seemed buried in profound reflection. &ldquo;To treat a fever,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in
      a manner which tends to produce one, seems indeed to be adding fuel to
      fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is&mdash;it is,&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;Let us trust this young man, General
      Witherington. We shall at least give our darlings the comforts of the
      fresh air and cold water, for which they are pining.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the General remained undecided. &ldquo;Your reasoning,&rdquo; he said to Hartley,
      &ldquo;seems plausible; but still it is only hypothesis. What can you show to
      support your theory, in opposition to the general practice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own observation,&rdquo; replied the young man. &ldquo;Here is a memorandum-book of
      medical cases which I have witnessed. It contains twenty cases of
      small-pox, of which eighteen were recoveries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the two others?&rdquo; said the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Terminated fatally,&rdquo; replied Hartley; &ldquo;we can as yet but partially disarm
      this scourge of the human race.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; continued the General, &ldquo;were I to say that a thousand gold
      mohrs were yours in case my children live under your treatment, what have
      you to peril in exchange?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My reputation,&rdquo; answered Hartley, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you could warrant on your reputation the recovery of your patients?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid I should be presumptuous! But I think I could warrant my using
      those means, which, with God's blessing, afford the fairest chance of a
      favourable result.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough&mdash;you are modest and sensible, as well as bold, and I will
      trust you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady, on whom Hartley's words and manner had made a great impression,
      and who was eager to discontinue a mode of treatment which subjected the
      patients to the greatest pain and privation, and had already proved
      unfortunate, eagerly acquiesced, and Hartley was placed in full authority
      in the sick room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Windows were thrown open, fires reduced or discontinued, loads of
      bed-clothes removed, cooling drinks superseded mulled wine and spices. The
      sick-nurses cried out murder. Doctors Tourniquet and Lancelot retired in
      disgust, menacing something like a general pestilence, in vengeance of
      what they termed rebellion against the neglect of the aphorisms of
      Hippocrates. Hartley proceeded quietly and steadily, and the patients got
      into a fair road of recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Northumbrian was neither conceited nor artful; yet, with all his
      plainness of character, he could not but know the influence which a
      successful physician obtains over the parents of the children whom he has
      saved from the grave, and especially before the cure is actually
      completed. He resolved to use this influence in behalf of his old
      companion, trusting that the military tenacity of General Witherington
      would give way on consideration of the obligation so lately conferred upon
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way to the General's house, which was at present his constant place
      of residence, he examined the package which Middlemas had put into his
      hand. It contained the picture of Menie Gray, plainly set, and the ring,
      with brilliants, which Doctor Gray had given to Richard, as his mother's
      last gift. The first of these tokens extracted from honest Hartley a sigh,
      perhaps a tear of sad remembrance. &ldquo;I fear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she has not chosen
      worthily; but she shall be happy, if I can make her so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the residence of General Witherington, our Doctor went first to
      the sick apartment, and then carried to their parents the delightful
      account, that the recovery of the children might be considered as certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May the God of Israel bless thee, young man!&rdquo; said the lady, trembling
      with emotion; &ldquo;thou hast wiped the tear from the eye of the despairing
      mother. And yet&mdash;alas! alas! still it must flow when I think of my
      cherub Reuben.&mdash;Oh! Mr. Hartley, why did we not know you a week
      sooner!&mdash;my darling had not then died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God gives and takes away, my lady,&rdquo; answered Hartley; &ldquo;and you must
      remember that two are restored to you out of three. It is far from
      certain, that the treatment I have used towards the convalescents would
      have brought through their brother; for the case, as reported to me, waa
      of a very inveterate description.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; said Witherington, his voice testifying more emotion than he
      usually or willingly gave way to, &ldquo;you can comfort the sick in spirit as
      well as the sick in body. But it is time we settle our wager. You betted
      your reputation, which remains with you, increased by all the credit due
      to your eminent success, against a thousand gold mohrs, the value of which
      you will find in that pocketbook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General Witherington,&rdquo; said Hartley, &ldquo;you are wealthy, and entitled to be
      generous&mdash;I am poor, and not entitled to decline whatever may be,
      even in a liberal sense, a compensation for my professional attendance.
      But there is a bound to extravagance, both in giving and accepting; and I
      must not hazard the newly acquired reputation with which you flatter me,
      by giving room to have it said, that I fleeced the parents, when their
      feelings were all afloat with anxiety for their children.&mdash;Allow me
      to divide this large sum; one half I will thankfully retain, as a most
      liberal recompense for my labour; and if you still think you owe me any
      thing, let me have it in the advantage of your good opinion and
      countenance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I acquiesce in your proposal, Doctor Hartley,&rdquo; said the General,
      reluctantly receiving back a part of the contents of the pocketbook, &ldquo;it
      is because I hope to serve you with my interest, even better than with my
      purse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And indeed, sir,&rdquo; replied Hartley, &ldquo;it was upon your interest that I am
      just about to make a small claim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General and his lady spoke both in the same breath, to assure him his
      boon was granted before asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so sure of that,&rdquo; said Hartley; &ldquo;for it respects a point on
      which I have heard say, that your Excellency is rather inflexible&mdash;the
      discharge of a recruit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My duty makes me so,&rdquo; replied the General&mdash;&ldquo;You know the sort of
      fellows that we are obliged to content ourselves with&mdash;they get drunk&mdash;grow
      pot-valiant&mdash;enlist over-night, and repent next morning. If I am to
      dismiss all those who pretend to have been trepanned, we should have few
      volunteers remain behind. Every one has some idle story of the promises of
      a swaggering sergeant Kite&mdash;It is impossible to attend to them. But
      let me hear yours, however.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine is a very singular case. The party has been robbed of a thousand
      pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A recruit for this service possessing a thousand pounds! My dear Doctor,
      depend upon it, the fellow has gulled you. Bless my heart, would a man who
      had a thousand pounds think of enlisting as a private sentinel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had no such thoughts,&rdquo; answered Hartley. &ldquo;He was persuaded by the
      rogue whom he trusted, that he was to have a commission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then his friend must have been Tom Hillary, or the devil; for no other
      could possess so much cunning and impudence. He will certainly find his
      way to the gallows at last. Still this story of the thousand pounds seems
      a touch even beyond Tom Hillary. What reason have you to think that this
      fellow ever had such a sum of money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the best reason to know it for certain,&rdquo; answered Hartley; &ldquo;he and
      I served our time together, under the same excellent master; and when he
      came of age, not liking the profession which he had studied, and obtaining
      possession of his little fortune, he was deceived by the promises of this
      same Hillary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has had him locked up in our well-ordered hospital yonder?&rdquo; said the
      General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so, please your Excellency,&rdquo; replied Hartley; &ldquo;not, I think, to cure
      him of any complaint, but to give him the opportunity of catching one,
      which would silence all enquiries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter shall be closely looked into. But how miserably careless the
      young man's friends must have been to let a raw lad go into the world with
      such a companion and guide as Tom Hillary, and such a sum as a thousand
      pounds in his pocket. His parents had better have knocked him on the head.
      It certainly was not done like canny Northumberland, as my servant Winter
      calls it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The youth must indeed have had strangely hard-hearted, or careless
      parents,&rdquo; said Mrs. Witherington, in accents of pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never knew them, madam,&rdquo; said Hartley; &ldquo;there was a mystery on the
      score of his birth. A cold, unwilling, and almost unknown hand, dealt him
      out his portion when he came of lawful age, and he was pushed into the
      world like a bark forced from shore, without rudder, compass, or pilot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here General Witherington involuntarily looked to his lady, while, guided
      by a similar impulse, her looks were turned upon him. They exchanged a
      momentary glance of deep and peculiar meaning, and then the eyes of both
      were fixed on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you brought up in Scotland?&rdquo; said the lady, addressing herself, in a
      faltering voice, to Hartley&mdash;&ldquo;And what was your master's name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I served my apprenticeship with Mr. Gideon Gray of the town of
      Middlemas,&rdquo; said Hartley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Middlemas! Gray?&rdquo; repeated the lady, and fainted away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hartley offered the succours of his profession; the husband flew to
      support her head, and the instant that Mrs. Witherington began to recover,
      he whispered to her, in a tone betwixt entreaty and warning, &ldquo;Zilia,
      beware&mdash;beware!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some imperfect sounds which she had begun to frame, died away upon her
      tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me assist you to your dressing-room, my love,&rdquo; said her obviously
      anxious husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      She arose with the action of an automaton, which moves at a touch of a
      spring, and half hanging upon her husband, half dragging herself on by her
      own efforts, had nearly reached the door of the room, when Hartley
      following, asked if he could be of any service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said the General, sternly; &ldquo;this is no case for a stranger's
      interference; when you are wanted I will send for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hartley stepped back on receiving a rebuff in a tone so different from
      that which General Witherington had used towards him in their previous
      intercourse, and felt disposed for the first time, to give credit to
      public report, which assigned to that gentleman, with several good
      qualities, the character of a very proud and haughty man. Hitherto, he
      thought, I have seen him tamed by sorrow and anxiety, now the mind is
      regaining its natural tension. But he must in decency interest himself for
      this unhappy Middlemas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General returned into the apartment a minute or two afterwards, and
      addressed Hartley in his usual tone of politeness, though apparently still
      under great embarrassment, which he in vain endeavoured to conceal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Witherington is better,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and will be glad to see you
      before dinner. You dine with us, I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hartley bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Witherington is rather subject to this sort of nervous fits, and she
      has been much harassed of late by grief and apprehension. When she
      recovers from them it is a few minutes before she can collect her ideas,
      and during such intervals&mdash;to speak very confidentially to you, my
      dear Doctor Hartley&mdash;she speaks sometimes about imaginary events
      which have never happened, and sometimes about distressing occurrences in
      an early period of life. I am not, therefore, willing that any one but
      myself, or her old attendant Mrs. Lopez, should be with her on such
      occasions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hartley admitted that a certain degree of light-headedness was often the
      consequence of nervous fits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General proceeded. &ldquo;As to this young man&mdash;this friend of yours&mdash;this
      Richard Middlemas&mdash;did you not call him so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I recollect,&rdquo; answered Hartley; &ldquo;but your Excellency has hit
      upon his name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is odd enough&mdash;Certainly you said something about Middlemas?&rdquo;
       replied General Witherington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mentioned the name of the town,&rdquo; said Hartley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and I caught it up as the name of the recruit&mdash;I was indeed
      occupied at the moment by my anxiety about my wife. But this Middlemas,
      since such is his name, is a wild young fellow, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should do him wrong to say so, your Excellency. He may have had his
      follies like other young men; but his conduct has, so far as I know, been
      respectable; but, considering we lived in the same house, we were not very
      intimate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is bad&mdash;I should have liked him&mdash;that is&mdash;it would
      have been happy for him to have had a friend like you. But I suppose you
      studied too hard for him. He would be a soldier, ha?&mdash;Is he
      good-looking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remarkably so,&rdquo; replied Hartley; &ldquo;and has a very prepossessing manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is his complexion dark or fair?&rdquo; asked the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather uncommonly dark,&rdquo; said Hartley,&mdash;&ldquo;darker, if I may use the
      freedom, than your Excellency's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, then, he must be a black ouzel, indeed!&mdash;Does he understand
      languages?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Latin and French tolerably well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he cannot fence or dance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, sir, I am no great judge; but Richard is reckoned to do both
      with uncommon skill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&mdash;Sum this up, and it sounds well. Handsome, accomplished in
      exercises, moderately learned, perfectly well-bred, not unreasonably wild.
      All this comes too high for the situation of a private sentinel. He must
      have a commission, Doctor&mdash;entirely for your sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Excellency is generous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be so; and I will find means to make Tom Hillary disgorge his
      plunder, unless he prefers being hanged, a fate he has long deserved. You
      cannot go back to the Hospital to-day. You dine with us, and you know Mrs.
      Witherington's fears of infection; but to-morrow find out your friend.
      Winter shall see him equipped with every thing needful. Tom Hillary shall
      repay advances, you know; and he must be off with the first detachment of
      the recruits, in the Middlesex Indiaman, which sails from the Downs on
      Monday fortnight; that is, if you think him fit for the voyage. I dare say
      the poor fellow is sick of the Isle of Wight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Excellency will permit the young man to pay his respects to you
      before his departure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what purpose, sir?&rdquo; said the General hastily and peremptorily; but
      instantly added, &ldquo;You are right&mdash;I should like to see him. Winter
      shall let him know the time, and take horses to fetch him hither. But he
      must have been out of the Hospital for a day or two; so the sooner you can
      set him at liberty the better. In the meantime, take him to your own
      lodgings, Doctor; and do not let him form any intimacies with the
      officers, or any others, in this place, where he may light on another
      Hillary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Had Hartley been as well acquainted as the reader with the circumstances
      of young Middlemas's birth, he might have drawn decisive conclusions from
      the behaviour of General Witherington, while his comrade was the topic of
      conversation. But as Mr. Gray and Middlemas himself were both silent on
      the subject, he knew little of it but from general report, which his
      curiosity had never induced him to scrutinize minutely. Nevertheless, what
      he did apprehend interested him so much, that he resolved upon trying a
      little experiment, in which he thought there could be no great harm. He
      placed on his finger the remarkable ring intrusted to his care by Richard
      Middlemas, and endeavoured to make it conspicuous in approaching Mrs.
      Witherington; taking care, however, that this occurred during her
      husband's absence. Her eyes had no sooner caught a sight of the gem, than
      they became riveted to it, and she begged a nearer sight of it, as
      strongly resembling one which she had given to a friend. Taking the ring
      from his finger, and placing it in her emaciated hand, Hartley informed
      her it was the property of the friend in whom he had just been
      endeavouring to interest the General. Mrs. Witherington retired in great
      emotion, but next day summoned Hartley to a private interview, the
      particulars of which, so far as are necessary to be known, shall be
      afterwards related.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the succeeding day after these important discoveries, Middlemas, to his
      great delight, was rescued from his seclusion in the Hospital, and
      transferred to his comrade's lodgings in the town of Ryde, of which
      Hartley himself was a rare inmate; the anxiety of Mrs. Witherington
      detaining him at the General's house, long after his medical attendance
      might have been dispensed with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within two or three days a commission arrived for Richard Middlemas, as a
      lieutenant in the service of the East India Company. Winter, by his
      master's orders, put the wardrobe of the young officer on a suitable
      footing; while Middlemas, enchanted at finding himself at once emancipated
      from his late dreadful difficulties, and placed under the protection of a
      man of such importance as the General, obeyed implicitly the hints
      transmitted to him by Hartley, and enforced by Winter, and abstained from
      going into public, or forming acquaintances with any one. Even Hartley
      himself he saw seldom; and, deep as were his obligations, he did not
      perhaps greatly regret the absence of one whose presence always affected
      him with a sense of humiliation and abasement.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER THE EIGHTH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The evening before he was to sail for the Downs, where the Middlesex lay
      ready to weigh anchor, the new lieutenant was summoned by Winter to attend
      him to the General's residence, for the purpose of being introduced to his
      patron, to thank him at once, and to bid him farewell. On the road, the
      old man took the liberty of schooling his companion concerning the respect
      which he ought to pay to his master, &ldquo;who was, though a kind and generous
      man as ever came from Northumberland, extremely rigid in punctiliously
      exacting the degree of honour which was his due.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While they were advancing towards the house, the General and his wife
      expected their arrival with breathless anxiety. They were seated in a
      superb drawing-room, the General behind a large chandelier, which, shaded
      opposite to his face, threw all the light to the other side of the table,
      so that he could observe any person placed there, without becoming the
      subject of observation in turn. On a heap of cushions, wrapped in a
      glittering drapery of gold and silver muslins, mingled with shawls, a
      luxury which was then a novelty in Europe, sate, or rather reclined, his
      lady, who, past the full meridian of beauty, retained charms enough to
      distinguish her as one who had been formerly a very fine woman, though her
      mind seemed occupied by the deepest emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zilia,&rdquo; said her husband, &ldquo;you are unable for what you have undertaken&mdash;take
      my advice&mdash;retire&mdash;you shall know all and everything that passes&mdash;but
      retire. To what purpose should you cling to the idle wish of beholding for
      a moment a being whom you can never again look upon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; answered the lady, &ldquo;and is not your declaration that I shall never
      see him more, a sufficient reason that I should wish to see him now&mdash;should
      wish to imprint on my memory the features and the form which I am never
      again to behold while we are in the body? Do not, my Richard, be more
      cruel than was my poor father, even when his wrath was in its bitterness.
      He let me look upon my infant, and its cherub face dwelt with me, and was
      my comfort among the years of unutterable sorrow in which my youth wore
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is enough, Zilia&mdash;you have desired this boon&mdash;I have granted
      it&mdash;and, at whatever risk, my promise shall be kept. But think how
      much depends on this fatal secret&mdash;your rank and estimation in
      society&mdash;my honour interested that that estimation should remain
      uninjured. Zilia, the moment that the promulgation of such a secret gives
      prudes and scandalmongers a right to treat you with scorn, will be fraught
      with unutterable misery, perhaps with bloodshed and death, should a man
      dare to take up the rumour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall be obeyed, my husband,&rdquo; answered Zilia, &ldquo;in all that the
      frailness of nature will permit. But oh, God of my fathers, of what clay
      hast thou fashioned us poor mortals, who dread so much the shame which
      follows sin, yet repent so little for the sin itself!&rdquo; In a minute
      afterwards steps were heard&mdash;the door opened&mdash;Winter announced
      Lieutenant Middlemas, and the unconscious son stood before his parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Witherington started involuntarily up, but immediately constrained himself
      to assume the easy deportment with which a superior receives a dependent,
      and which, in his own case, was usually mingled with a certain degree of
      hauteur. The mother had less command of herself. She, too, sprung up, as
      if with the intention of throwing herself on the neck of her son, for whom
      she had travailed and sorrowed. But the warning glance of her husband
      arrested her as if by magic, and she remained standing, with her beautiful
      head and neck somewhat advanced, her hands clasped together, and extended
      forward in the attitude of motion, but motionless, nevertheless, as a
      marble statue, to which the sculptor has given all the appearance of life,
      but cannot impart its powers. So strange a gesture and posture might have
      excited the young officer's surprise; but the lady stood in the shade, and
      he was so intent in looking upon his patron, that he was scarce even
      conscious of Mrs. Witherington's presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am happy in this opportunity,&rdquo; said Middlemas, observing that the
      General did not speak, &ldquo;to return my thanks to General Witherington, to
      whom they never can be sufficiently paid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sound of his voice, though uttering words so indifferent, seemed to
      dissolve the charm which kept his mother motionless. She sighed deeply,
      relaxed the rigidity of her posture, and sunk back on the cushions from
      which she had started up. Middlemas turned a look towards her at the sound
      of the sigh, and the rustling of her drapery. The General hastened to
      speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife, Mr. Middlemas, has been unwell of late&mdash;your friend, Mr.
      Hartley, might mention it to you&mdash;an affection of the nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Middlemas was, of course, sorry and concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have had distress in our family, Mr. Middlemas, from the ultimate and
      heart-breaking consequences of which we have escaped by the skill of your
      friend, Mr. Hartley. We will be happy if it is in our power to repay a
      part of our obligations in service to his friend and protege, Mr.
      Middlemas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am only acknowledged as <i>his</i> protege, then,&rdquo; <i>thought</i>
      Richard; but he <i>said</i>, &ldquo;Every one must envy his friend in having had
      the distinguished good fortune to be of use to General Witherington and
      his family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have received your commission, I presume. Have you any particular
      wish or desire respecting your destination?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, may it please your Excellency,&rdquo; answered Middlemas. &ldquo;I suppose
      Hartley would tell your Excellency my unhappy state&mdash;that I am an
      orphan, deserted by the parents who cast me on the wide world, an outcast
      about whom nobody knows or cares, except to desire that I should wander
      far enough, and live obscurely enough, not to disgrace them by their
      connexion with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zilia wrung her hands as he spoke, and drew her muslin veil closely around
      her head as if to exclude the sounds which excited her mental agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hartley was not particularly communicative about your affairs,&rdquo; said
      the General; &ldquo;nor do I wish to give you the pain of entering into them.
      What I desire to know is, if you are pleased with your destination to
      Madras?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly, please your Excellency&mdash;anywhere, so that there is no
      chance of meeting the villain Hillary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Hillary's services are too necessary in the purlieus of St. Giles's,
      the Lowlights of Newcastle, and such like places, where human carrion can
      be picked up, to be permitted to go to India. However, to show you the
      knave has some grace, there are the notes of which you were robbed. You
      will find them the very same paper which you lost, except a small sum
      which the rogue had spent, but which a friend has made up, in compassion
      for your sufferings.&rdquo; Richard Middlemas sunk on one knee, and kissed the
      hand which restored him to independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said the General, &ldquo;you are a silly young man;&rdquo; but he withdrew
      not his hand from his caresses. This was one of the occasions on which
      Dick Middlemas could be oratorical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, my more than father,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how much greater a debt do I owe to
      you than to the unnatural parents, who brought me into this world by their
      sin, and deserted me through their cruelty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zilia, as she heard these cutting words, flung back her veil, raising it
      on both hands till it floated behind her like a mist, and then giving a
      faint groan, sunk down in a swoon. Pushing Middlemas from him with a hasty
      movement, General Witherington flew to his lady's assistance, and carried
      her in his arms, as if she had been a child, into the anteroom, where an
      old servant waited with the means of restoring suspended animation, which
      the unhappy husband too truly anticipated might be useful. These were
      hastily employed, and succeeded in calling the sufferer to life, but in a
      state of mental emotion that was dreadful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mind was obviously impressed by the last words which her son had
      uttered.&mdash;&ldquo;Did you hear him, Richard,&rdquo; she exclaimed, in accents
      terribly loud, considering the exhausted state of her strength&mdash;&ldquo;Did
      you hear the words? It was Heaven speaking our condemnation by the voice
      of our own child. But do not fear, my Richard, do not weep! I will answer
      the thunder of Heaven with its own music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flew to a harpsichord which stood in the room, and, while the servant
      and master gazed on each other, as if doubting whether her senses were
      about to leave her entirely, she wandered over the keys, producing a
      wilderness of harmony, composed of passages recalled by memory, or
      combined by her own musical talent, until at length her voice and
      instrument united in one of those magnificent hymns in which her youth had
      praised her Maker, with voice and harp, like the Royal Hebrew who composed
      it. The tear ebbed insensibly from the eyes which she turned upwards&mdash;her
      vocal tones, combining with those of the instrument, rose to a pitch of
      brilliancy seldom attained by the most distinguished performers, and then
      sunk into a dying cadence, which fell, never again to rise,&mdash;for the
      songstress had died with her strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horror of the distracted husband may be conceived, when all efforts to
      restore life proved totally ineffectual. Servants were despatched for
      medical men&mdash;Hartley, and every other who could be found. The General
      precipitated himself into the apartment they had so lately left, and in
      his haste ran, against Middlemas, who, at the sound of the music from the
      adjoining apartment, had naturally approached nearer to the door, and
      surprised and startled by the sort of clamour, hasty steps, and confused
      voices which ensued, had remained standing there, endeavouring to
      ascertain the cause of so much disorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of the unfortunate young man wakened the General's stormy
      passions to frenzy. He seemed to recognise his son only as the cause of
      his wife's death. He seized him by the collar, and shook him violently as
      he dragged him into the chamber of mortality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come hither,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;thou for whom a life of lowest obscurity was too
      mean a fate&mdash;come hither, and look on the parents whom thou hast so
      much envied&mdash;whom thou hast so often cursed. Look at that pale
      emaciated form, a figure of wax, rather than flesh and blood&mdash;that is
      thy mother&mdash;that is the unhappy Zilia Moncada, to whom thy birth was
      the source of shame and misery, and to whom thy ill-omened presence has
      now brought death itself. And behold me&rdquo;&mdash;he pushed the lad from him,
      and stood up erect, looking wellnigh in gesture and figure the apostate
      spirit he described&mdash;&ldquo;Behold me,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;see you not my hair
      streaming with sulphur, my brow scathed with lightning? I am the
      Arch-Fiend&mdash;I am the father whom you seek&mdash;I am the accursed
      Richard Tresham, the seducer of Zilia, and the father of her murderer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hartley entered while this horrid scene was passing. All attention to the
      deceased, he instantly saw, would be thrown away; and understanding,
      partly from Winter, partly from the tenor of the General's frantic
      discourse, the nature of the disclosure which had occurred, he hastened to
      put an end, if possible, to the frightful and scandalous scene which had
      taken place. Aware how delicately the General felt on the subject of
      reputation, he assailed him with remonstrances on such conduct, in
      presence of so many witnesses. But the mind had ceased to answer to that
      once powerful keynote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care not if the whole world hear my sin and my punishment,&rdquo; said
      Witherington. &ldquo;It shall not be again said of me, that I fear shame more
      than I repent sin. I feared shame only for Zilia, and Zilia is dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But her memory, General&mdash;spare the memory of your wife, in which the
      character of your children is involved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no children!&rdquo; said the desperate and violent man. &ldquo;My Reuben is
      gone to Heaven, to prepare a lodging for the angel who has now escaped
      from the earth in a flood of harmony, which can only be equalled where she
      is gone. The other two cherubs will not survive their mother. I shall be,
      nay, I already feel myself, a childless man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet I am your son,&rdquo; replied Middlemas, in a tone sorrowful, but at the
      same time tinged with sullen resentment&mdash;&ldquo;Your son by your wedded
      wife. Pale as she lies there, I call upon you both to acknowledge my
      rights, and all who are present to bear witness to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretch!&rdquo; exclaimed the maniac father, &ldquo;canst thou think of thine own
      sordid rights in the midst of death and frenzy? My son?&mdash;thou art the
      fiend who has occasioned my wretchedness in this world, and who will share
      my eternal misery in the next. Hence from my sight, and my curse go with
      thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes fixed on the ground, his arms folded on his breast, the haughty
      and dogged spirit of Middlemas yet seemed to meditate reply. But Hartley,
      Winter, and other bystanders interfered, and forced him from the
      apartment. As they endeavoured to remonstrate with him, he twisted himself
      out of their grasp, ran to the stables, and seizing the first saddled
      horse that he found, out of many that had been in haste got ready to seek
      for assistance, he threw himself on its back, and rode furiously off.
      Hartley was about to mount and follow him; but Winter and the other
      domestics threw themselves around him, and implored him not to desert
      their unfortunate master, at a time when the influence which he had
      acquired over him might be the only restraint on the violence of his
      passions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had a <i>coup de soleil</i> in India,&rdquo; whispered Winter, &ldquo;and is
      capable of any thing in his fits. These cowards cannot control him, and I
      am old and feeble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Satisfied that General Witherington was a greater object of compassion
      than Middlemas, whom besides he had no hope of overtaking, and who he
      believed was safe in his own keeping, however violent might be his present
      emotions, Hartley returned where the greater emergency demanded his
      immediate care.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the unfortunate General contending with the domestics, who
      endeavoured to prevent his making his way to the apartment where his
      children slept, and exclaiming furiously&mdash;&ldquo;Rejoice, my treasures&mdash;rejoice!&mdash;He
      has fled, who would proclaim your father's crime, and your mother's
      dishonour!&mdash;He has fled, never to return, whose life has been the
      death of one parent, and the ruin of another!&mdash;Courage, my children,
      your father is with you&mdash;he will make his way to you through a
      hundred obstacles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The domestics, intimidated and undecided, were giving way to him, when
      Adam Hartley approached, and placing himself before the unhappy man, fixed
      his eye firmly on the General's, while he said in a low but stern voice&mdash;&ldquo;Madman,
      would you kill your children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General seemed staggered in his resolution, but still attempted to
      rush past him. But Hartley, seizing him by the collar of his coat on each
      side, &ldquo;You are my prisoner,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I command you to follow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! prisoner, and for high treason? Dog, thou hast met thy death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The distracted man drew a poniard from his bosom, and Hartley's strength
      and resolution might not perhaps have saved his life, had not Winter
      mastered the General's right hand, and contrived to disarm him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am your prisoner, then,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;use me civilly&mdash;and let me see
      my wife and children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall see them to-morrow,&rdquo; said Hartley; &ldquo;follow us instantly, and
      without the least resistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      General Witherington followed like a child, with the air of one who is
      suffering for a cause in which he glories.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not ashamed of my principles,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;I am willing to die
      for my king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without exciting his frenzy, by contradicting the fantastic idea which
      occupied his imagination, Hartley continued to maintain over his patient
      the ascendency he had acquired. He caused him to be led to his apartment,
      and beheld him suffer himself to be put to bed. Administering then a
      strong composing draught, and causing a servant to sleep in the room, he
      watched the unfortunate man till dawn of morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Witherington awoke in his full senses, and apparently conscious of
      his real situation, which he testified by low groans, sobs, and tears.
      When Hartley drew near his bedside, he knew him perfectly, and said, &ldquo;Do
      not fear me&mdash;the fit is over&mdash;leave me now, and see after yonder
      unfortunate. Let him leave Britain as soon as possible, and go where his
      fate calls him, and where we can never meet more. Winter knows my ways,
      and will take care of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winter gave the same advice. &ldquo;I can answer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for my master's
      security at present; but in Heaven's name, prevent his ever meeting again,
      with that obdurate young man!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER THE NINTH.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Well, then, the world's mine oyster,
    Which I with sword will open.
                MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR.
</pre>
    <p>
      When Adam Hartley arrived at his lodgings in the sweet little town of
      Ryde, his first enquiries were after his comrade. He had arrived last
      night late, man and horse all in a foam. He made no reply to any questions
      about supper or the like, but snatching a candle, ran up stairs into his
      apartment, and shut and double-locked the door. The servants only
      supposed, that, being something intoxicated, he had ridden hard, and was
      unwilling to expose himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hartley went to the door of his chamber, not without some apprehensions;
      and after knocking and calling more than once, received at length the
      welcome return, &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On Hartley announcing himself, the door opened, and Middlemas appeared,
      well dressed, and with his hair arranged and powdered; although, from the
      appearance of the bed, it had not been slept in on the preceding night,
      and Richard's countenance, haggard and ghastly, seemed to bear witness to
      the same fact. It was, however, with an affectation of indifference that
      he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I congratulate you on your improvement in worldly knowledge, Adam. It is
      just the time to desert the poor heir, and to stick by him that is in
      immediate possession of the wealth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I staid last night at General Witherington's,&rdquo; answered Hartley, &ldquo;because
      he is extremely ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him to repent of his sins, then,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;Old Gray used to
      say, a doctor had as good a title to give ghostly advice as a parson. Do
      you remember Doctor Dulberry, the minister, calling him an interloper? Ha!
      Ha! Ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am surprised at this style of language from one in your circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, ay,&rdquo; said Middlemas, with a bitter smile&mdash;&ldquo;it would be
      difficult to most men to keep up their spirits, after gaining and losing
      father, mother, and a good inheritance, all in the same day. But I had
      always a turn for philosophy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really do not understand you, Mr. Middlemas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I found my parents yesterday, did I not?&rdquo; answered the young man.
      &ldquo;My mother, as you know, had waited but that moment to die, and my father
      to become distracted; and I conclude both were contrived purposely to
      cheat me of my inheritance, as he has taken up such a prejudice against
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inheritance?&rdquo; repeated Hartley, bewildered by Richard's calmness, and
      half suspecting that the insanity of the father was hereditary in the
      family. &ldquo;In Heaven's name, recollect yourself, and get rid of these
      hallucinations. What inheritance are you dreaming of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That of my mother, to be sure, who must have inherited old Moncada's
      wealth&mdash;and to whom should it descend, save to her children?&mdash;I
      am the eldest of them&mdash;that fact cannot be denied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But consider, Richard&mdash;recollect yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Richard; &ldquo;and what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you cannot but remember,&rdquo; said Hartley, &ldquo;that unless there was a
      will in your favour, your birth prevents you from inheriting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken, sir, I am legitimate.&mdash;Yonder sickly brats, whom
      you rescued from the grave, are not more legitimate than I am.&mdash;Yes!
      our parents could not allow the air of Heaven to breathe on them&mdash;me
      they committed to the winds and the waves&mdash;I am nevertheless their
      lawful child, as well as their puling offspring of advanced age and
      decayed health. I saw them, Adam&mdash;Winter showed the nursery to me
      while they were gathering courage to receive me in the drawing-room. There
      they lay, the children of predilection, the riches of the East expended
      that they might sleep soft and wake in magnificence. I, the eldest brother&mdash;the
      heir&mdash;I stood beside their bed in the borrowed dress which I had so
      lately exchanged for the rags of an hospital. Their couches breathed the
      richest perfumes, while I was reeking from a pest-house; and I&mdash;I
      repeat it&mdash;the heir, the produce of their earliest and best love, was
      thus treated. No wonder that my look was that of a basilisk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak as if you were possessed with an evil spirit,&rdquo; said Hartley;
      &ldquo;or else you labour under a strange delusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think those only are legally married over whom a drowsy parson has
      read the ceremony from a dog's-eared prayer-book? It may be so in your
      English law&mdash;but Scotland makes Love himself the priest. A vow
      betwixt a fond couple, the blue heaven alone witnessing, will protect a
      confiding girl against the perjury of a fickle swain, as much as if a Dean
      had performed the rites in the loftiest cathedral in England. Nay, more;
      if the child of love be acknowledged by the father at the time when he is
      baptized&mdash;if he present the mother to strangers of respectability as
      his wife, the laws of Scotland will not allow him to retract the justice
      which has, in these actions, been done to the female whom he has wronged,
      or the offspring of their mutual love. This General Tresham, or
      Witherington, treated my unhappy mother as his wife before Gray and
      others, quartered her as such in the family of a respectable man, gave her
      the same name by which he himself chose to pass for the time. He presented
      me to the priest as his lawful offspring; and the law of Scotland,
      benevolent to the helpless child, will not allow him now to disown what he
      so formally admitted. I know my rights, and am determined to claim them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not then intend to go on board the Middlesex? Think a little&mdash;You
      will lose your voyage and your commission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will save my birth-right,&rdquo; answered Middlemas. &ldquo;When I thought of going
      to India, I knew not my parents, or how to make good the rights which I
      had through them. That riddle is solved. I am entitled to at least a third
      of Moncada's estate, which, by Winter's account, is considerable. But for
      you, and your mode of treating the small-pox, I should have had the whole.
      Little did I think, when old Gray was likely to have his wig pulled off,
      for putting out fires, throwing open windows, and exploding whisky and
      water, that the new system of treating the small-pox was to cost me so
      many thousand pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are determined then,&rdquo; said Hartley, &ldquo;on this wild course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know my rights, and am determined to make them available,&rdquo; answered the
      obstinate youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Richard Middlemas, I am sorry for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Adam Hartley, I beg to know why I am honoured by your sorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pity you,&rdquo; answered Hartley, &ldquo;both for the obstinacy of selfishness,
      which can think of wealth after the scene you saw last night, and for the
      idle vision which leads you to believe that you can obtain possession of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Selfish!&rdquo; cried Middlemas; &ldquo;why, I am a dutiful son, labouring to clear
      the memory of a calumniated mother&mdash;And am I a visionary?&mdash;Why,
      it was to this hope that I awakened, when old Moncada's letter to Gray,
      devoting me to perpetual obscurity, first roused me to a sense of my
      situation, and dispelled the dreams of my childhood. Do you think that I
      would ever have submitted to the drudgery which I shared with you, but
      that, by doing so, I kept in view the only traces of these unnatural
      parents, by means of which I proposed to introduce myself to their notice,
      and, if necessary, enforce the rights of a legitimate child? The silence
      and death of Moncada broke my plans, and it was then only I reconciled
      myself to the thoughts of India.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were very young to have known so much of the Scottish law, at the
      time when we were first acquainted,&rdquo; said Hartley. &ldquo;But I can guess your
      instructor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No less authority than Tom Hillary's,&rdquo; replied Middlemas. &ldquo;His good
      counsel on that head is a reason why I do not now prosecute him to the
      gallows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I judged as much,&rdquo; replied Hartley; &ldquo;for I heard him, before I left
      Middlemas, debating the point with Mr. Lawford; and I recollect perfectly,
      that he stated the law to be such as you now lay down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what said Lawford in answer?&rdquo; demanded Middlemas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He admitted,&rdquo; replied Hartley, &ldquo;that in circumstances where the case was
      doubtful, such presumptions of legitimacy might be admitted. But he said
      they were liable to be controlled by positive and precise testimony, as,
      for instance, the evidence of the mother declaring the illegitimacy of the
      child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there can exist none such in my case,&rdquo; said Middlemas hastily, and
      with marks of alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not deceive you, Mr. Middlemas, though I fear I cannot help giving
      you pain. I had yesterday a long conference with your mother, Mrs.
      Witherington, in which she acknowledged you as her son, but a son born
      before marriage. This express declaration will, therefore, put an end to
      the suppositions on which you ground your hopes. If you please, you may
      hear the contents of her declaration, which I have in her own
      handwriting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confusion! is the cup to be for ever dashed from my lips?&rdquo; muttered
      Richard; but recovering his composure, by exertion of the self-command, of
      which he possessed so large a portion, he desired Hartley to proceed with
      his communication. Hartley accordingly proceeded to inform him of the
      particulars preceding his birth, and those which followed after it; while
      Middlemas, seated on a sea-chest, listened with inimitable composure to a
      tale which went to root up the flourishing hopes of wealth which he had
      lately so fondly entertained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zilia Moncada was the only child of a Portuguese Jew of great wealth, who
      had come to London, in prosecution of his commerce. Among the few
      Christians who frequented his house, and occasionally his table, was
      Richard Tresham, a gentleman of a high Northumbrian family, deeply engaged
      in the service of Charles Edward during his short invasion, and though
      holding a commission in the Portuguese service, still an object of
      suspicion to the British government, on account of his well-known courage
      and Jacobitical principles. The high-bred elegance of this gentleman,
      together with his complete acquaintance with the Portuguese language and
      manners, had won the intimacy of old Moncada, and, alas! the heart of the
      inexperienced Zilia, who, beautiful as an angel, had as little knowledge
      of the world and it's wickedness as the lamb that is but a week old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tresham made his proposals to Moncada, perhaps in a manner which too
      evidently showed that he conceived the high-born Christian was degrading
      himself in asking an alliance with the wealthy Jew. Moncada rejected his
      proposals, forbade him his house, but could not prevent the lovers from
      meeting in private. Tresham made a dishonourable use of the opportunities
      which the poor Zilia so incautiously afforded, and the consequence was her
      ruin. The lover, however, had every purpose of righting the injury which
      he had inflicted, and, after various plans of secret marriage, which were
      rendered abortive by the difference of religion, and other circumstances,
      flight for Scotland was determined on. The hurry of the journey, the fear
      and anxiety to which Zilia was subjected, brought on her confinement
      several weeks before the usual time, so that they were compelled to accept
      of the assistance and accommodation offered by Mr. Gray. They had not been
      there many hours ere Tresham heard, by the medium of some sharp-sighted or
      keen-eared friend, that there were warrants out against him for
      treasonable practices. His correspondence with Charles Edward had become
      known to Moncada during the period of their friendship; he betrayed it in
      vengeance to the British cabinet, and warrants were issued, in which, at
      Moncada's request, his daughter's name was included. This might be of use,
      he apprehended, to enable him to separate his daughter from Tresham,
      should he find the fugitives actually married. How far he succeeded, the
      reader already knows, as well as the precautions which he took to prevent
      the living evidence of his child's frailty from being known to exist. His
      daughter he carried with him, and subjected her to severe restraint, which
      her own reflections rendered doubly bitter. It would have completed his
      revenge, had the author of Zilia's misfortunes been brought to the
      scaffold for his political offences. But Tresham skulked among his friends
      in the Highlands, and escaped until the affair blew over.
    </p>
    <p>
      He afterwards entered into the East India Company's service, under his
      mother's name of Witherington, which concealed the Jacobite and rebel,
      until these terms were forgotten. His skill in military affairs soon
      raised him to riches and eminence. When he returned to Britain, his first
      enquiries were after the family of Moncada. His fame, his wealth, and the
      late conviction that his daughter never would marry any but him who had
      her first love, induced the old man to give that encouragement to General
      Witherington, which he had always denied to the poor and outlawed Major
      Tresham; and the lovers, after having been fourteen years separated, were
      at length united in wedlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Witherington eagerly concurred in the earnest wish of his
      father-in-law, that every remembrance of former events should be buried,
      by leaving the fruit of the early and unhappy intrigue suitably provided
      for, but in a distant and obscure situation. Zilia thought far otherwise.
      Her heart longed, with a mother's longing, towards the object of her first
      maternal tenderness, but she dared not place herself in opposition at once
      to the will of her father, and the decision of her husband. The former,
      his religious prejudices much effaced by his long residence in England,
      had given consent that she should conform to the established religion of
      her husband and her country,&mdash;the latter, haughty as we have
      described him, made it his pride to introduce the beautiful convert among
      his high-born kindred. The discovery of her former frailty would have
      proved a blow to her respectability, which he dreaded like death; and it
      could not long remain a secret from his wife, that in consequence of a
      severe illness in India, even his reason became occasionally shaken by
      anything which violently agitated his feelings. She had, therefore,
      acquiesced in patience and silence in the course of policy which Moncada
      had devised, and which her husband anxiously and warmly approved. Yet her
      thoughts, even when their marriage was blessed with other offspring,
      anxiously reverted to the banished and outcast child, who had first been
      clasped to the maternal bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these feelings, &ldquo;subdued and cherished long,&rdquo; were set afloat in full
      tide by the unexpected discovery of this son, redeemed from a lot of
      extreme misery, and placed before his mother's imagination in
      circumstances so disastrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in vain that her husband had assured her that he would secure the
      young man's prosperity, by his purse and his interest. She could not be
      satisfied, until she had herself done something to alleviate the doom of
      banishment to which her eldest-born was thus condemned. She was the more
      eager to do so, as she felt the extreme delicacy of her health, which was
      undermined by so many years of secret suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Witherington was, in conferring her maternal bounty, naturally led to
      employ the agency of Hartley, the companion of her son, and to whom, since
      the recovery of her younger children, she almost looked up as to a tutelar
      deity. She placed in his hands a sum of L2000, which she had at her own
      unchallenged disposal, with a request, uttered in the fondest and most
      affectionate terms, that it might be applied to the service of Richard
      Middlemas in the way Hartley should think most useful to him. She assured
      him of further support, as it should be needed; and a note to the
      following purport was also intrusted him, to be delivered when and where
      the prudence of Hartley should judge it proper to confide to him the
      secret of his birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Benoni! Oh, child of my sorrow!&rdquo; said this interesting document, &ldquo;why
      should the eyes of thy unhappy mother be about to obtain permission to
      look on thee, since her arms were denied the right to fold thee to her
      bosom? May the God of Jews and of Gentiles watch over thee, and guard
      thee! May he remove, in his good time, the darkness which rolls between me
      and the beloved of my heart&mdash;the first fruit of my unhappy, nay,
      unhallowed affection. Do not&mdash;do not, my beloved!&mdash;think thyself
      a lonely exile, while thy mother's prayers arise for thee at sunrise and
      at sunset, to call down every blessing on thy head&mdash;to invoke every
      power in thy protection and defence. Seek not to see me&mdash;Oh, why must
      I say so!&mdash;But let me humble myself in the dust, since it is my own
      sin, my own folly, which I must blame!&mdash;but seek not to see or speak
      with me&mdash;it might be the death of both. Confide thy thoughts to the
      excellent Hartley, who hath been the guardian angel of us all&mdash;even
      as the tribes of Israel had each their guardian angel. What thou shalt
      wish, and he shall advise in thy behalf, shall be done, if in the power of
      a mother&mdash;And the love of a mother! Is it bounded by seas, or can
      deserts and distance measure its limits? Oh, child of my sorrow! Oh,
      Benoni! let thy spirit be with mine, as mine is with thee.&rdquo; Z. M.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these arrangements being completed, the unfortunate lady next insisted
      with her husband that she should be permitted to see her son in that
      parting interview which terminated so fatally. Hartley, therefore, now
      discharged as her executor, the duty intrusted to him as her confidential
      agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he thought, as, having finished his communication, he was about
      to leave the apartment, &ldquo;surely the demons of Ambition and Avarice will
      unclose the talons which they have fixed upon this man, at a charm like
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And indeed Richard's heart had been formed of the nether millstone, had he
      not been duly affected by these first and last tokens of his mother's
      affection. He leant his head upon a table, and his tears flowed
      plentifully. Hartley left him undisturbed for more than an hour, and on
      his return found him in nearly the same attitude in which he had left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret to disturb you at this moment,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I have still a
      part of my duty to discharge. I must place in your possession the deposit
      which your mother made in my hands&mdash;and I must also remind you that
      time flies fast, and that you have scarce an hour or two to determine
      whether you will prosecute your Indian voyage, under the new view of
      circumstances which I have opened to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Middlemas took the bills which his mother had bequeathed him. As he raised
      his head, Hartley could observe that his face was stained with tears. Yet
      he counted over the money with mercantile accuracy; and though he assumed
      the pen for the purpose of writing a discharge with an air of inconsolable
      dejection, yet he drew it up in good set terms, like one who had his
      senses much at his command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he said, in a mournful voice, &ldquo;give me my mother's narrative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hartley almost started, and answered hastily, &ldquo;You have the poor lady's
      letter, which was addressed to yourself&mdash;the narrative is addressed
      to me. It is my warrant for disposing of a large sum of money&mdash;it
      concerns the rights of third parties, and I cannot part with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, surely it were better to deliver it into my hands, were it but to
      weep over it,&rdquo; answered Middlemas. &ldquo;My fortune, Hartley, has been very
      cruel. You see that my parents purposed to have made me their undoubted
      heir; yet their purpose was disappointed by accident. And now my mother
      comes with well-intended fondness, and while she means to advance my
      fortune, furnishes evidence to destroy it.&mdash;Come, come, Hartley&mdash;you
      must be conscious that my mother wrote those details entirely for my
      information. I am the rightful owner, and insist on having them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry I must insist on refusing your demand,&rdquo; answered Hartley,
      putting the papers in his pocket. &ldquo;You ought to consider, that if this
      communication has destroyed the idle and groundless hopes which you have
      indulged in, it has, at the same time, more than trebled your capital; and
      that if there are some hundreds or thousands in the world richer than
      yourself, there are many millions not half so well provided. Set a brave
      spirit, then, against your fortune, and do not doubt your success in
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His words seemed to sink into the gloomy mind of Middlemas. He stood
      silent for a moment, and then answered with a reluctant and insinuating
      voice,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Hartley, we have long been companions&mdash;you can have neither
      pleasure nor interest in ruining my hopes&mdash;you may find some in
      forwarding them. Moncada's fortune will enable me to allow five thousand
      pounds to the friend who should aid me in my difficulties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning to you, Mr. Middlemas,&rdquo; said Hartley, endeavouring to
      withdraw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment&mdash;one moment,&rdquo; said Middlemas, holding his friend by the
      button at the same time, &ldquo;I meant to say ten thousand&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;marry
      whomsoever you like&mdash;I will not be your hindrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a villain!&rdquo; said Hartley, breaking from him, &ldquo;and I always
      thought you so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you,&rdquo; answered Middlemas, &ldquo;are a fool, and I never thought yon
      better. Off he goes&mdash;Let him&mdash;the game has been played and lost&mdash;I
      must hedge my bets: India must be my back-play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All was in readiness for his departure. A small vessel and a favouring
      gale conveyed him and several other military gentlemen to the Downs, where
      the Indiaman, which was to transport them from Europe, lay ready for their
      reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first feelings were sufficiently disconsolate. But accustomed from his
      infancy to conceal his internal thoughts, he appeared in the course of a
      week the gayest and best bred passenger who ever dared the long and weary
      space betwixt Old England and her Indian possessions. At Madras, where the
      sociable feelings of the resident inhabitants give ready way to enthusiasm
      in behalf of any stranger of agreeable qualities, he experienced that warm
      hospitality which distinguishes the British character in the East.
    </p>
    <p>
      Middlemas was well received in company, and in the way of becoming an
      indispensable guest at every entertainment in the place, when the vessel,
      on board of which Hartley acted as surgeon's mate, arrived at the same
      settlement. The latter would not, from his situation, have been entitled
      to expect much civility and attention; but this disadvantage was made up
      by his possessing the most powerful introductions from General
      Witherington, and from other persons of weight in Leadenhall Street, the
      General's friends, to the principal inhabitants in the settlement. He
      found himself once more, therefore, moving in the same sphere with
      Middlemas, and under the alternative of living with him on decent and
      distant terms, or of breaking off with him altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of these courses might perhaps have been the wisest; but the
      other was most congenial to the blunt and plain character of Hartley, who
      saw neither propriety nor comfort in maintaining a show of friendly
      intercourse, to conceal hate, contempt, and mutual dislike.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circle at Fort St. George was much more restricted at that time than
      it has been since. The coldness of the young men did not escape notice; it
      transpired that they had been once intimates and fellow-students; yet it
      was now found that they hesitated at accepting invitations to the same
      parties. Rumour assigned many different and incompatible reasons for this
      deadly breach, to which Hartley gave no attention whatever, while
      Lieutenant Middlemas took care to countenance those which represented the
      cause of the quarrel most favourably to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little bit of rivalry had taken place,&rdquo; he said, when pressed by
      gentlemen for an explanation; &ldquo;he had only had the good luck to get
      further in the good graces of a fair lady than his friend Hartley, who had
      made a quarrel of it, as they saw. He thought it very silly to keep up
      spleen, at such a distance of time and space. He was sorry, more for the
      sake of the strangeness of the appearance of the thing than any thing
      else, although his friend had really some very good points about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While these whispers were working their effect in society, they did not
      prevent Hartley from receiving the most flattering assurances of
      encouragement and official promotion from the Madras government as
      opportunity should arise. Soon after, it was intimated to him that a
      medical appointment of a lucrative nature in a remote settlement was
      conferred on him, which removed him for some time from Madras and its
      neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hartley accordingly sailed on his distant expedition; and it was observed,
      that after his departure, the character of Middlemas, as if some check had
      been removed, began to display itself in disagreeable colours. It was
      noticed that this young man, whose manners were so agreeable and so
      courteous during the first months after his arrival in India, began now to
      show symptoms of a haughty and overbearing spirit. He had adopted, for
      reasons which the reader may conjecture, but which appeared to be mere
      whim, at Fort St. George, the name of Tresham, in addition to that by
      which he had hitherto been distinguished, and in this he presisted with an
      obstinacy, which belonged more to the pride than the craft of his
      character. The Lieutenant-Colonel of the regiment, an old cross-tempered
      martinet, did not choose to indulge the Captain (such was now the rank of
      Middlemas) in this humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knew no officer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;by any name save that which he bore in his
      commission,&rdquo; and he Middlemass'd the Captain on all occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      One fatal evening, the Captain was so much provoked, as to intimate
      peremptorily, &ldquo;that he knew his own name best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Captain Middlemas,&rdquo; replied the Colonel, &ldquo;it is not every child that
      knows its own father, so how can every man be so sure of his own name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bow was drawn at a venture, but the shaft found the rent in the
      armour, and stung deeply. In spite of all the interposition which could be
      attempted, Middlemas insisted on challenging the Colonel, who could be
      persuaded to no apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Captain Middlemas,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;thought the cap fitted, he was welcome
      to wear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The result was a meeting, in which, after the parties had exchanged shots,
      the seconds tendered their mediation. It was rejected by Middlemas, who,
      at the second fire, had the misfortune to kill his commanding officer. In
      consequence, he was obliged to fly from the British settlements; for,
      being universally blamed for having pushed the quarrel to extremity, there
      was little doubt that the whole severity of military discipline would be
      exercised upon the delinquent. Middlemas, therefore, vanished from Fort
      St. George, and, though the affair had made much noise at the time, was
      soon no longer talked of. It was understood, in general, that he had gone
      to seek that fortune at the court of some native prince, which he could no
      longer hope for in the British settlements.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER THE TENTH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Three years passed away after the fatal encounter mentioned in the last
      Chapter, and Doctor Hartley returning from his appointed mission, which
      was only temporary, received encouragement to settle in Madras in a
      medical capacity; and upon having done so, soon had reason to think he had
      chosen a line in which he might rise to wealth and reputation. His
      practice was not confined to his countrymen, but much sought after among
      the natives, who, whatever may be their prejudices against the Europeans
      in other respects, universally esteem their superior powers in the medical
      profession. This lucrative branch of practice rendered it necessary that
      Hartley should make the Oriental languages his study, in order to hold
      communication with his patients without the intervention of an
      interpreter. He had enough of opportunities to practise as a linguist,
      for, in acknowledgment, as he used jocularly to say, of the large fees of
      the wealthy Moslemah and Hindoos, he attended the poor of all nations
      gratis, whenever he was called upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so chanced, that one evening he was hastily summoned by a message from
      the Secretary of the Government, to attend a patient of consequence. &ldquo;Yet
      he is, after all, only a Fakir,&rdquo; said the message. &ldquo;You will find him at
      the tomb of Cara Razi, the Mahomedan saint and doctor, about one coss from
      the fort. Enquire for him by the name of Barak el Hadgi. Such a patient
      promises no fees; but we know how little you care about the pagodas; and,
      besides, the Government is your paymaster on this occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the last matter to be thought on,&rdquo; said Hartley, and instantly
      repaired in his palanquin to the place pointed out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tomb of the Owliah, or Mahomedan Saint, Cara Razi, was a place held in
      much reverence by every good Mussulman. It was situated in the centre of a
      grove of mangos and tamarind-trees, and was built of red stone, having
      three domes, and minarets at every corner. There was a court in front, as
      usual, around which were cells constructed for the accommodation of the
      Fakirs who visited the tomb from motives of devotion, and made a longer or
      shorter residence there as they thought proper, subsisting upon the alms
      which the Faithful never fail to bestow on them in exchange for the
      benefit of their prayers. These devotees were engaged day and night in
      reading verses of the Koran before the tomb, which was constructed of
      white marble, inscribed with sentences from the book of the Prophet, and
      with the various titles conferred by the Koran upon the Supreme Being.
      Such a sepulchre, of which there are many, is, with its appendages and
      attendants, respected during wars and revolutions, and no less by
      Feringis, (Franks, that is,) and Hindoos, than by Mahomedans themselves.
      The Fakirs, in return, act as spies for all parties, and are often
      employed in secret missions of importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Complying with the Mahomedan custom, our friend Hartley laid aside his
      shoes at the gates of the holy precincts, and avoiding to give offence by
      approaching near to the tomb, he went up to the principal Moullah, or
      priest who was distinguishable by the length of his beard, and the size of
      the large wooden beads, with which the Mahomedans, like the Catholics,
      keep register of their prayers. Such a person, venerable by his age,
      sanctity of character, and his real or supposed contempt of worldly
      pursuits and enjoyments, is regarded as the head of an establishment of
      this kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Moullah is permitted by his situation to be more communicative with
      strangers than his younger brethren, who in the present instance remained
      with their eyes fixed on the Koran, muttering their recitations without
      noticing the European, or attending to what he said, as he enquired at
      their superior for Barak el Hadgi.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Moullah was seated on the earth, from which he did not arise, or show
      any mark of reverence; nor did he interrupt the tale of his beads, which
      he continued to count assiduously while Hartley was speaking. When he
      finished, the old man raised his eyes, and looked at him with an air of
      distraction, as if he was endeavouring to recollect what he had been
      saying; he at length pointed to one of the cells, and resumed his
      devotions like one who felt impatient of whatever withdrew his attention
      from his sacred duties, were it but for an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hartley entered the cell indicated, with the usual salutation of Salam
      Alaikum. His patient lay on a little carpet in a corner of the small
      white-washed cell. He was a man of about forty, dressed in the black robe
      of his order, very much torn and patched. He wore a high conical cap of
      Tartarian felt, and had round his neck the string of black beads belonging
      to his order. His eyes and posture indicated suffering, which he was
      enduring with stoical patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salam Alaikum,&rdquo; said Hartley; &ldquo;you are in pain, my father?&rdquo;&mdash;a title
      which he gave rather to the profession than to the years of the person he
      addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Salam Alaikum bema sebastem</i>,&rdquo; answered the Fakir; &ldquo;Well is it for
      you that you have suffered patiently. The book saith, such shall be the
      greeting of the angels to those who enter paradise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation being thus opened, the physician proceeded to enquire
      into the complaints of the patient, and to prescribe what he thought
      advisable. Having done this, he was about to retire, when, to his great
      surprise, the Fakir tendered him a ring of some value.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wise,&rdquo; said Hartley, declining the present, and at the same time
      paying a suitable compliment to the Fakir's cap and robe,&mdash;&ldquo;the wise
      of every country are brethren. My left hand takes no guerdon of my right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Feringi can then refuse gold?&rdquo; said the Fakir. &ldquo;I thought they took it
      from every hand, whether pure as that of an Houri, or leprous like
      Gehazi's&mdash;even as the hungry dog recketh not whether the flesh he
      eateth be of the camel of the prophet Saleth, or of the ass of Degial&mdash;on
      whose head be curses!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The book says,&rdquo; replied Hartley, &ldquo;that it is Allah who closes and who
      enlarges the heart. Frank and Mussulman are all alike moulded by his
      pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother hath spoken wisely,&rdquo; answered the patient. &ldquo;Welcome the
      disease, if it bring thee acquainted with a wise physician. For what saith
      the poet&mdash;'It is well to have fallen to the earth, if while
      grovelling there thou shalt discover a diamond.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The physician made repeated visits to his patient, and continued to do so
      even after the health of El Hadgi was entirely restored. He had no
      difficulty in discerning in him one of those secret agents frequently
      employed by Asiatic Sovereigns. His intelligence, his learning, above all,
      his versatility and freedom from prejudices of every kind, left no doubt
      of Barak's possessing the necessary qualifications for conducting such
      delicate negotiations; while his gravity of habit and profession could not
      prevent his features from expressing occasionally a perception of humour,
      not usually seen in devotees of his class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barak el Hadgi talked often, amidst their private conversations, of the
      power and dignity of the Nawaub of Mysore; and Hartley had little doubt
      that he came from the Court of Hyder Ali, on some secret mission, perhaps
      for achieving a more solid peace betwixt that able and sagacious Prince
      and the East India Company's Government,&mdash;that which existed for the
      time being regarded on both parts as little more than a hollow and
      insincere truce. He told many stories to the advantage of this Prince, who
      certainly was one of the wisest that Hindostan could boast; and amidst
      great crimes, perpetrated to gratify his ambition, displayed many
      instances of princely generosity, and, what was a little more surprising,
      of even-handed justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one occasion, shortly before Barak el Hadgi left Madras, he visited the
      Doctor, and partook of his sherbet, which he preferred to his own, perhaps
      because a few glasses of rum or brandy were usually added to enrich the
      compound. It might be owing to repeated applications to the jar which
      contained this generous fluid, that the Pilgrim became more than usually
      frank in his communications, and not contented with praising his Nawaub
      with the most hyperbolic eloquence, he began to insinuate the influence
      which he himself enjoyed with the Invincible, the Lord and Shield of the
      Faith of the Prophet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother of my soul,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do but think if thou needest aught that
      the all-powerful Hyder Ali Khan Bohander can give; and then use not the
      intercession of those who dwell in palaces, and wear jewels in their
      turbans, but seek the cell of thy brother at the Great City, which is
      Seringapatam. And the poor Fakir, in his torn cloak, shall better advance
      thy suit with the Nawaub [for Hyder did not assume the title of Sultann]
      than they who sit upon seats of honour in the Divan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these and sundry other expressions of regard, he exhorted Hartley to
      come into the Mysore, and look upon the face of the Great Prince, whose
      glance inspired wisdom, and whose nod conferred wealth, so that Folly or
      Poverty could not appear before him. He offered at the same time to
      requite the kindness which Hartley had evinced to him, by showing him
      whatever was worthy the attention of a sage in the land of Mysore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hartley was not reluctant to promise to undertake the proposed journey, if
      the continuance of good understanding betwixt their governments should
      render it practicable, and in reality looked forward to the possibility of
      such an event with a good deal of interest. The friends parted with mutual
      good wishes, after exchanging in the Oriental fashion, such gifts as
      became sages, to whom knowledge was to be supposed dearer than wealth.
      Barak el Hadgi presented Hartley with a small quantity of the balsam of
      Mecca, very hard to be procured in an unadulterated form, and gave him at
      the same time a passport in a peculiar character, which he assured him
      would be respected by every officer of the Nawaub, should his friend be
      disposed to accomplish his visit to the Mysore. &ldquo;The head of him who
      should disrespect this safe-conduct,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;shall not be more safe
      than that of the barley-stalk which the reaper has grasped in his hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hartley requited these civilities by the present of a few medicines little
      used in the East, but such as he thought might, with suitable directions,
      be safely intrusted to a man so intelligent as his Moslem friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was several months after Barak had returned to the interior of India,
      that Hartley was astonished by an unexpected rencounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ships from Europe had but lately arrived, and had brought over their
      usual cargo of boys longing to be commanders, and young women without any
      purpose of being married, but whom a pious duty to some brother, some
      uncle, or other male relative, brought to India to keep his house, until
      they should find themselves unexpectedly in one of their own. Dr. Hartley
      happened to attend a public breakfast given on this occasion by a
      gentleman high in the service. The roof of his friend had been recently
      enriched by a consignment of three nieces, whom the old gentleman, justly
      attached to his quiet hookah, and, it was said, to a pretty girl of
      colour, desired to offer to the public, that he might have the fairest
      chance to get rid of his new guests as soon as possible. Hartley, who was
      thought a fish worth casting a fly for, was contemplating this fair
      investment, with very little interest, when he heard one of the company
      say to another in a low voice,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angels and ministers! there is our old acquaintance, the Queen of Sheba,
      returned upon our hands like unsaleable goods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hartley looked in the same direction with the two who were speaking, and
      his eye was caught by a Semiramis-looking person, of unusual stature and
      amplitude, arrayed in a sort of riding-habit, but so formed, and so looped
      and gallooned with lace, as made it resemble the upper tunic of a native
      chief. Her robe was composed of crimson silk, rich with flowers of gold.
      She wore wide trowsers of light blue silk, a fine scarlet shawl around her
      waist, in which was stuck a creeze with a richly ornamented handle. Her
      throat and arms were loaded with chains and bracelets, and her turban,
      formed of a shawl similar to that worn around her waist, was decorated by
      a magnificent aigrette, from which a blue ostrich plume flowed in one
      direction, and a red one in another. The brow, of European complexion, on
      which this tiara rested, was too lofty for beauty, but seemed made for
      command; the aquiline nose retained its form, but the cheeks were a little
      sunken, and the complexion so very brilliant, as to give strong evidence
      that the whole countenance had undergone a thorough repair since the lady
      had left her couch. A black female slave, richly dressed, stood behind her
      with a chowry, or cow's tail, having a silver handle, which she used to
      keep off the flies. From the mode in which she was addressed by those who
      spoke to her, this lady appeared a person of too much importance to be
      affronted or neglected, and yet one with whom none desired further
      communication than the occasion seemed in propriety to demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not, however, stand in need of attention. The well-known captain
      of an East Indian vessel lately arrived from Britain was sedulously polite
      to her; and two or three gentlemen, whom Hartley knew to be engaged in
      trade, tended upon her as they would have done upon the safety of a rich
      argosy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven's sake, what is that for a Zenobia?&rdquo; said Hartley, to the
      gentleman whose whisper had first attracted his attention to this lofty
      dame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible you do not know the Queen of Sheba?&rdquo; said the person of
      whom he enquired, no way both to communicate the information demanded.
      &ldquo;You must know, then, that she is the daughter of a Scotch emigrant, who
      lived and died at Pondicherry, a sergeant in Lally's regiment. She managed
      to marry a partisan officer named Montreville, a Swiss or Frenchman, I
      cannot tell which. After the surrender of Pondicherry, this hero and
      heroine&mdash;But hey&mdash;what the devil are you thinking of?&mdash;If
      you stare at her that way, you will make a scene; for she will think
      nothing of scolding you across the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But without attending to his friend's remonstrances, Hartley bolted from
      the table at which he sat, and made his way, with something less than the
      decorum which the rules of society enjoin, towards the place where the
      lady in question was seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Doctor is surely mad this morning&rdquo;&mdash;said his friend Major Mercer
      to old Quartermaster Calder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, Hartley was not perhaps strictly in his senses; for looking at the
      Queen of Sheba as he listened to Major Mercer, his eye fell on a light
      female form beside her, so placed as if she desired to be eclipsed by the
      bulky form and flowing robes we have described, and to his extreme
      astonishment, he recognised the friend of his childhood, the love of his
      youth&mdash;Menie Gray herself!
    </p>
    <p>
      To see her in India was in itself astonishing. To see her apparently under
      such strange patronage, greatly increased his surprise. To make his way to
      her, and address her, seemed the natural and direct mode of satisfying the
      feelings which her appearance excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      His impetuosity was, however, checked, when, advancing close upon Miss
      Gray and her companion, he observed that the former, though she looked at
      him, exhibited not the slightest token of recognition, unless he could
      interpret as such, that she slightly touched her upper lip with her
      fore-finger, which, if it happened otherwise than by mere accident, might
      be construed to mean, &ldquo;Do not speak to me just now.&rdquo; Hartley, adopting
      such an interpretation, stood stock still, blushing deeply; for he was
      aware that he made for the moment but a silly figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the rather convinced of this, when, with a voice which in the force
      of its accents corresponded with her commanding air, Mrs. Montreville
      addressed him in English, which savoured slightly of a Swiss patois,&mdash;&ldquo;You
      have come to us very fast, sir, to say nothing at all. Are you sure you
      did not get your tongue stolen by de way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I had seen an old friend in that lady, madam,&rdquo; stammered
      Hartley, &ldquo;but it seems I am mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The good people do tell me that you are one Doctors Hartley, sir. Now, my
      friend and I do not know Doctors Hartley at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not the presumption to pretend to your acquaintance, madam, but
      him&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Menie repeated the sign in such a manner, that though it was only
      momentary, Hartley could not misunderstand its purpose; he therefore
      changed the end of his sentence, and added, &ldquo;But I have only to make my
      bow, and ask pardon for my mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He retired back accordingly among the company, unable to quit the room,
      and enquiring at those whom he considered as the best newsmongers for such
      information as&mdash;&ldquo;Who is that stately-looking woman, Mr. Butler?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the Queen of Sheba, to be sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is that pretty girl, who sits beside her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or rather behind her,&rdquo; answered Butler, a military chaplain; &ldquo;faith, I
      cannot say&mdash;Pretty did you call her?&rdquo; turning his opera-glass that
      way&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, faith, she is pretty&mdash;very pretty&mdash;Gad, she
      shoots her glances as smartly from behind the old pile yonder, as Teucer
      from behind Ajax Telamon's shield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who is she, can you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some fair-skinned speculation of old Montreville's, I suppose, that she
      has got either to toady herself, or take in some of her black friends
      with.&mdash;Is it possible you have never heard of old Mother
      Montreville?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I have been so long absent from Madras&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Butler, &ldquo;this lady is the widow of a Swiss officer in
      the French service, who after the surrender of Pondicherry, went off into
      the interior, and commenced soldier on his own account. He got possession
      of a fort, under pretence of keeping it for some simple Rajah or other;
      assembled around him a parcel of desperate vagabonds, of every colour in
      the rainbow; occupied a considerable territory, of which he raised the
      duties in his own name, and declared for independence. But Hyder Naig
      understood no such interloping proceedings, and down he came, besieged the
      fort and took it, though some pretend it was betrayed to him by this very
      woman. Be that as it may, the poor Swiss was found dead on the ramparts.
      Certain it is, she received large sums of money, under pretence of paying
      off her troops, surrendering of hill-forts, and Heaven knows what besides.
      She was permitted also to retain some insignia of royalty; and, as she was
      wont to talk of Hyder as the Eastern Solomon, she generally became known
      by the title of Queen of Sheba. She leaves her court when she pleases, and
      has been as far as Fort St. George before now. In a word, she does pretty
      much as she likes. The great folks here are civil to her, though they look
      on her as little better than a spy. As to Hyder, it is supposed he has
      ensured her fidelity by borrowing the greater part of her treasures, which
      prevents her from daring to break with him&mdash;besides other causes that
      smack of scandal of another sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A singular story,&rdquo; replied Hartley to his companion, while his heart
      dwelt on the question, How it was possible that the gentle and simple
      Menie Gray should be in the train of such a character as this adventuress?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Butler has not told you the best of it,&rdquo; said Major Mercer, who by
      this time came round to finish his own story. &ldquo;Your old acquaintance, Mr.
      Tresham, or Mr. Middlemas, or whatever else he chooses to be called, has
      been complimented by a report, that he stood very high in the good graces
      of this same Boadicea. He certainly commanded some troops which she stills
      keeps on foot, and acted at their head in the Nawaub's service, who
      craftily employed him in whatever could render him odious to his
      countrymen. The British prisoners were intrusted to his charge, and, to
      judge by what I felt myself, the devil might take a lesson from him in
      severity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was he attached to, or connected with, this woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Mrs. Rumour told us in our dungeon. Poor Jack Ward had the bastinado
      for celebrating their merits in a parody on the playhouse song,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'Sure such a pair were never seen,
    So aptly formed to meet by nature.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Hartley could listen no longer. The fate of Menie Gray, connected with
      such a man and such a woman, rushed on his fancy in the most horrid
      colours, and he was struggling through the throng to get to some place
      where he might collect his ideas, and consider what could be done for her
      protection, when a black attendant touched his arm, and at the same time
      slipped a card into his hand. It bore, &ldquo;Miss Gray, Mrs. Montreville's, at
      the house of Ram Sing Cottah, in the Black Town.&rdquo; On the reverse was
      written with a pencil, &ldquo;Eight in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This intimation of her residence implied, of course, a permission, nay, an
      invitation, to wait upon her at the hour specified. Hartley's heart beat
      at the idea of seeing her once more, and still more highly at the thought
      of being able to serve her. At least, he thought, if there is danger near
      her, as is much to be suspected, she shall not want a counsellor, or, if
      necessary, a protector. Yet, at the same time, he felt the necessity of
      making himself better acquainted with the circumstances of her case, and
      the persons with whom she seemed connected. Butler and Mercer had both
      spoke to their disparagement; but Butler was a little of a coxcomb, and
      Mercer a great deal of a gossip. While he was considering what credit was
      due to their testimony, he was unexpectedly encountered by a gentleman of
      his own profession, a military surgeon, who had had the misfortune to have
      been in Hyder's prison, till set at freedom by the late pacification. Mr.
      Esdale, for so he was called, was generally esteemed a rising man, calm,
      steady, and deliberate in forming his opinions. Hartley found it easy to
      turn the subject on the Queen of Sheba, by asking whether her Majesty was
      not somewhat of an adventuress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my word, I cannot say,&rdquo; answered Esdale, smiling; &ldquo;we are all upon the
      adventure in India, more or less; but I do not see that the Begum
      Montreville is more so than the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that Amazonian dress and manner,&rdquo; said Hartley, &ldquo;savour a little of
      the <i>picaresca</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not,&rdquo; said Esdale, &ldquo;expect a woman who has commanded soldiers,
      and may again, to dress and look entirely like an ordinary person. But I
      assure you, that even at this time of day, if she wished to marry, she
      might easily find a respectable match.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I heard that she had betrayed her husband's fort to Hyder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, that is a specimen of Madras gossip. The fact is, that she defended
      the place long after her husband fell, and afterwards surrendered it by
      capitulation. Hyder, who piques himself on observing the rules of justice,
      would not otherwise have admitted her to such intimacy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have heard,&rdquo; replied Hartley, &ldquo;that their intimacy was rather of
      the closest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another calumny, if you mean any scandal,&rdquo; answered Esdale. &ldquo;Hyder is too
      zealous a Mahomedan to entertain a Christian mistress; and, besides, to
      enjoy the sort of rank which is yielded to a woman in her condition, she
      must refrain, in appearance at least, from all correspondence in the way
      of gallantry. Just so they said that the poor woman had a connexion with
      poor Middlemas of the &mdash;&mdash; regiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was that also a false report?&rdquo; said Hartley, in breathless anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my soul, I believe it was,&rdquo; answered Mr. Esdale. &ldquo;They were friends,
      Europeans in an Indian court, and therefore intimate; but I believe
      nothing more. By the by, though, I believe there was some quarrel between
      Middlemas, poor fellow, and you; yet I am sure that you will be glad to
      hear there is a chance of his affair being made up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; was again the only word which Hartley could utter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, indeed,&rdquo; answered Esdale. &ldquo;The duel is an old story now; and it must
      be allowed that poor Middlemas, though he was rash in that business, had
      provocation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But his desertion&mdash;his accepting of command under Hyder&mdash;his
      treatment of our prisoners&mdash;How can all these be passed over?&rdquo;
       replied Hartley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it is possible&mdash;I speak to you as a cautious man, and in
      confidence&mdash;that he may do us better service in Hyder's capital, or
      Tippoo's camp, than he could have done if serving with his own regiment.
      And then, for his treatment of prisoners, I am sure I can speak nothing
      but good of him in that particular. He was obliged to take the office,
      because those that serve Hyder Naig must do or die. But he told me himself&mdash;and
      I believe him&mdash;that he accepted the office chiefly because, while he
      made a great bullying at us before the black fellows, he could privately
      be of assistance to us. Some fools could not understand this, and answered
      him with abuse and lampoons; and he was obliged to punish them, to avoid
      suspicion. Yes, yes, I and others can prove he was willing to be kind, if
      men would give him leave. I hope to thank him at Madras one day soon&mdash;All
      this in confidence&mdash;Good-morrow to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Distracted by the contradictory intelligence he had received, Hartley went
      next to question old Captain Capstern, the Captain of the Indiaman, whom
      he had observed in attendance upon the Begum Montreville. On enquiring
      after that commander's female passengers, he heard a pretty long catalogue
      of names, in which that he was so much interested in did not occur. On
      closer enquiry, Capstern recollected that Menie Gray, a young Scotchwoman,
      had come out under charge of Mrs. Duffer, the master's wife. &ldquo;A good
      decent girl,&rdquo; Capstern said, &ldquo;and kept the mates and guinea-pigs at a
      respectable distance. She came out,&rdquo; he believed, &ldquo;to be a sort of female
      companion, or upper servant in Madame Montreville's family. Snug berth
      enough,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;if she can find the length of the old girl's
      foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was all that could be made of Capstern; so Hartley was compelled to
      remain in a state of uncertainty until the next morning, when an
      explanation might be expected with Menie Gray in person.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER THE ELEVENTH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The exact hour assigned found Hartley at the door of the rich native
      merchant, who, having some reasons for wishing to oblige the Begum Mon
      treville, had relinquished, for her accommodation and that of her numerous
      retinue, almost the whole of his large and sumptuous residence in the
      Black Town of Madras, as that district of the city is called which the
      natives occupy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A domestic, at the first summons, ushered the visitor into an apartment,
      where he expected to be joined by Miss Gray. The room opened on one side
      into a small garden or parterre, filled with the brilliant-coloured
      flowers of Eastern climates; in the midst of which the waters of a
      fountain rose upwards in a sparkling jet, and fell back again into a white
      marble cistern.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thousand dizzy recollections thronged on the mind of Hartley, whose
      early feelings towards the companion of his youth, if they had slumbered
      during distance and the various casualties of a busy life, were revived
      when he found himself placed so near her, and in circumstances which
      interested from their unexpected occurrence and mysterious character. A
      step was heard&mdash;the door opened&mdash;a female appeared&mdash;but it
      was the portly form of Madame de Montreville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you please to want, sir?&rdquo; said the lady; &ldquo;that is, if you have
      found your tongue this morning, which you had lost yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I proposed myself the honour of waiting upon the young person, whom I saw
      in your excellency's company yesterday morning,&rdquo; answered Hartley, with
      assumed respect. &ldquo;I have had long the honour of being known to her in
      Europe, and I desire to offer my services to her in India.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much obliged&mdash;much obliged; but Miss Gray is gone out, and does not
      return for one or two days. You may leave your commands with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, madam,&rdquo; replied Hartley; &ldquo;but I have some reason to hope you
      may be mistaken in this matter&mdash;And here comes the lady herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is this, my dear?&rdquo; said Mrs. Montreville, with unruffled front, to
      Menie, as she entered; &ldquo;are you not gone out for two or three days, as I
      tell this gentleman?&mdash;<i>mais c'est egal</i>&mdash;it is all one
      thing. You will say, How d'ye do, and good-bye, to Monsieur, who is so
      polite as to come to ask after our healths, and as he sees us both very
      well, he will go away home again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, madam,&rdquo; said Miss Gray, with appearance of effort, &ldquo;that I
      must speak with this gentleman for a few minutes in private, if you will
      permit me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say, get you gone? but I do not allow that&mdash;I do not like
      private conversation between young man and pretty young woman; <i>cela
      n'est pas honnete</i>. It cannot be in my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be out of it, then, madam,&rdquo; answered Miss Gray, not pettishly nor
      pertly, but with the utmost simplicity.&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Hartley, will you step
      into that garden?&mdash;and, you, madam, may observe us from the window,
      if it be the fashion of the country to watch so closely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke this she stepped through a lattice-door into the garden, and
      with an air so simple, that she seemed as if she wished to comply with her
      patroness's ideas of decorum, though they appeared strange to her. The
      Queen of Sheba, notwithstanding her natural assurance, was disconcerted by
      the composure of Miss Gray's manner, and left the room, apparently in
      displeasure. Menie turned back to the door which opened into the garden,
      and said in the same manner as before, but with less nonchalance,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I would not willingly break through the rules of a foreign
      country; but I cannot refuse myself the pleasure of speaking to so old a
      friend,&mdash;if indeed,&rdquo; she added, pausing and looking at Hartley, who
      was much embarrassed, &ldquo;it be as much pleasure to Mr. Hartley as it is to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been,&rdquo; said Hartley, scarce knowing what he said&mdash;&ldquo;it
      must be a pleasure to me in every circumstance&mdash;But this
      extraordinary meeting&mdash;But your father&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Menie Gray's handkerchief was at her eyes.&mdash;&ldquo;He is gone, Mr. Hartley.
      After he was left unassisted, his toilsome business became too much for
      him&mdash;he caught a cold which hung about him, as you know he was the
      last to attend to his own complaints, till it assumed a dangerous, and,
      finally, a fatal character. I distress you, Mr. Hartley, but it becomes
      you well to be affected. My father loved you dearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Miss Gray!&rdquo; said Hartley, &ldquo;it should not have been thus with my
      excellent friend at the close of his useful and virtuous life&mdash;Alas,
      wherefore&mdash;the question bursts from me involuntarily&mdash;wherefore
      could you not have complied with his wishes?&mdash;wherefore&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not ask me,&rdquo; said she, stopping the question which was on his lips;
      &ldquo;we are not the formers of our own destiny. It is painful to talk on such
      a subject; but for once, and for ever, let me tell you that I should have
      done Mr. Hartley wrong, if, even to secure his assistance to my father, I
      had accepted his hand, while my wayward affections did not accompany the
      act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But wherefore do I see you here, Menie?&mdash;Forgive me, Miss Gray, my
      tongue as well as my heart turns back to long-forgotten scenes&mdash;But
      why here?&mdash;why with this woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not, indeed, every thing that I expected,&rdquo; answered Menie; &ldquo;but I
      must not be prejudiced by foreign manners, after the step I have taken&mdash;She
      is, besides, attentive, and generous in her way, and I shall soon&rdquo;&mdash;she
      paused a moment, and then added, &ldquo;be under better protection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That of Richard Middlemas?&rdquo; said Hartley with a faltering voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought not, perhaps, to answer the question,&rdquo; said Menie; &ldquo;but I am a
      bad dissembler, and those whom I trust, I trust entirely. You have guessed
      right, Mr. Hartley,&rdquo; she added,&mdash;colouring a good deal, &ldquo;I have come
      hither to unite my fate to that of your old comrade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, then, just as I feared!&rdquo; exclaimed Hartley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why should Mr. Hartley fear?&rdquo; said Menie Gray. &ldquo;I used to think you
      too generous&mdash;surely the quarrel which occurred long since ought not
      to perpetuate suspicion and resentment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, if the feeling of resentment remained in my own bosom, it would
      be the last I should intrude upon you, Miss Gray,&rdquo; answered Hartley. &ldquo;But
      it is for you, and for you alone, that I am watchful.&mdash;This person&mdash;this
      gentleman whom you mean to intrust with your happiness&mdash;do you know
      where he is&mdash;and in what service?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know both, more distinctly perhaps than Mr. Hartley can do. Mr.
      Middlemas has erred greatly, and has been severely punished. But it was
      not in the time of his exile and sorrow, that she who has plighted her
      faith to him should, with the flattering world, turn her back upon him.
      Besides, you have, doubtless, not heard of his hopes of being restored to
      his country and his rank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; answered Hartley, thrown off his guard; &ldquo;but I see not how he
      can deserve it, otherwise than by becoming a traitor to his new master,
      and thus rendering himself even more unworthy of confidence than I hold
      him to be at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well that he hears you not,&rdquo; answered Menie Gray, resenting, with
      natural feeling, the imputation on her lover. Then instantly softening her
      tone she added, &ldquo;My voice ought not to aggravate, but to soothe your
      quarrel. Mr. Hartley, I plight my word to you that you do Richard wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said these words with affected calmness, suppressing all appearance of
      that displeasure, of which she was evidently sensible, upon this
      depreciation of a beloved object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hartley compelled himself to answer in the same strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Gray,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your actions and motives will always be those of an
      angel; but let me entreat you to view this most important matter with the
      eyes of worldly wisdom and prudence. Have you well weighed the risks
      attending the course which you are taking in favour of a man, who,&mdash;nay,
      I will not again offend you&mdash;who may, I hope, deserve your favour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I wished to see you in this manner, Mr. Hartley, and declined a
      communication in public, where we could have had less freedom of
      conversation, it was with the view of telling you every thing. Some pain I
      thought old recollections might give, but I trusted it would be momentary;
      and, as I desire to retain your friendship, it is proper I should show
      that I still deserve it. I must then first tell you my situation after my
      father's death. In the world's opinion we were always poor, you know; but
      in the proper sense I had not known what real poverty was, until I was
      placed in dependence upon a distant relation of my poor father, who made
      our relationship a reason for casting upon me all the drudgery of her
      household, while she would not allow that it gave me a claim to
      countenance, kindness, or anything but the relief of my most pressing
      wants. In these circumstances I received from Mr. Middlemas a letter, in
      which he related his fatal duel, and its consequences. He had not dared to
      write to me to share his misery&mdash;Now, when he was in a lucrative
      situation, under the patronage of a powerful prince, whose wisdom knew how
      to prize and protect such Europeans as entered his service&mdash;now, when
      he had every prospect of rendering our government such essential service
      by his interest with Hyder Ali, and might eventually nourish hopes of
      being permitted to return and stand his trial for the death of his
      commanding officer&mdash;now, he pressed me to come to India, and share
      his reviving fortunes, by accomplishing the engagement into which we had
      long ago entered. A considerable sum of money accompanied this letter.
      Mrs. Duffer was, pointed out as a respectable woman, who would protect me
      during the passage. Mrs. Montreville, a lady of rank, having large
      possessions and high interest in the Mysore, would receive me on my
      arrival at Fort St. George, and conduct me safely to the dominions of
      Hyder. It was farther recommended, that, considering the peculiar
      situation of Mr. Middlemas, his name should be concealed in the
      transaction, and that the ostensible cause of my voyage should be to fill
      an office in that lady's family&mdash;What was I to do?&mdash;My duty to
      my poor father was ended, and my other friends considered the proposal as
      too advantageous to be rejected. The references given, the sum of money
      lodged, were considered as putting all scruples out of the question, and
      my immediate protectress and kinswoman was so earnest that I should accept
      of the offer made me, as to intimate that she would not encourage me to
      stand in my own light, by continuing to give me shelter and food, (she
      gave me little more,) if I was foolish enough to refuse compliance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sordid wretch!&rdquo; said Hartley, &ldquo;how little did she deserve such a charge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me speak a proud word, Mr. Hartley, and then you will not perhaps
      blame my relations so much. All their persuasions, and even their threats,
      would have failed in inducing me to take a step, which has an appearance,
      at least, to which I found it difficult to reconcile myself. But I had
      loved Middlemas&mdash;I love him still&mdash;why should I deny it?&mdash;and
      I have not hesitated to trust him. Had it not been for the small still
      voice which reminded me of my engagements, I had maintained more
      stubbornly the pride of womanhood, and, as you would perhaps have
      recommended, I might have expected, at least, that my lover should have
      come to Britain in person, and might have had the vanity to think,&rdquo; she
      added, smiling faintly, &ldquo;that if I were worth having, I was worth
      fetching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet now&mdash;even now,&rdquo; answered Hartley, &ldquo;be just to yourself while you
      are generous to your lover.&mdash;Nay, do not look angrily, but hear me. I
      doubt the propriety of your being under the charge of this unsexed woman,
      who can no longer be termed a European. I have interest enough with
      females of the highest rank in the settlement&mdash;this climate is that
      of generosity and hospitality&mdash;there is not one of them, who, knowing
      your character and history, will not desire to have you in her society,
      and under her protection, until your lover shall be able to vindicate his
      title to your hand in the face of the world.&mdash;I myself will be no
      cause of suspicion to him, or of inconvenience to you, Menie. Let me but
      have your consent to the arrangement I propose, and the same moment that
      sees you under honourable and unsuspected protection, I will leave Madras,
      not to return till your destiny is in one way or other permanently fixed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Hartley,&rdquo; said Miss Gray. &ldquo;It may, it must be, friendly in you thus
      to advise me; but it would be most base in me to advance my own affairs at
      the expense of your prospects. Besides, what would this be but taking the
      chance of contingencies, with the view of sharing poor Middlemas's
      fortunes, should they prove prosperous, and casting him off, should they
      be otherwise? Tell me only, do you, of your own positive knowledge, aver
      that you consider this woman as an unworthy and unfit protectress for so
      young a person as I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of my own knowledge I can say nothing; nay, I must own, that reports
      differ even concerning Mrs. Montreville's character. But surely the mere
      suspicion&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mere suspicion, Mr. Hartley, can have no weight with me, considering
      that I can oppose to it the testimony of the man with whom I am willing to
      share my future fortunes. You acknowledge the question is but doubtful,
      and should not the assertion of him of whom I think so highly decide my
      belief in a doubtful matter? What, indeed, must he be, should this Madame
      Montreville be other than he represented her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What must he be, indeed!&rdquo; thought Hartley internally, but his lips
      uttered not the words. He looked down in a deep reverie, and at length
      started from it at the words of Miss Gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is time to remind you, Mr. Hartley, that we must needs part. God bless
      and preserve you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, dearest Menie,&rdquo; exclaimed Hartley as he sunk on one knee, and
      pressed to his lips the hand which she held out to him. &ldquo;God bless you!&mdash;you
      must deserve blessing. God protect you!&mdash;you must need protection.&mdash;Oh,
      should things prove different from what you hope, send for me instantly,
      and if man can aid you, Adam Hartley will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He placed in her hand a card containing his address. He then rushed from
      the apartment. In the hall he met the lady of the mansion, who made him a
      haughty reverence in token of adieu, while a native servant of the upper
      class, by whom she was attended, made a low and reverential salam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hartley hastened from the Black Town, more satisfied than before that some
      deceit was about to be practised towards Menie Gray&mdash;more determined
      than ever to exert himself for her preservation; yet more completely
      perplexed, when he began to consider the doubtful character of the danger
      to which she might be exposed, and the scanty means of protection which
      she had to oppose to it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER THE TWELFTH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As Hartley left the apartment in the house of Ram Sing Cottah by one mode
      of exit, Miss Gray retired by another, to an apartment destined for her
      private use. She, too, had reason for secret and anxious reflection, since
      all her love for Middlemas, and her full confidence in his honour, could
      not entirely conquer her doubts concerning the character of the person
      whom he had chosen for her temporary protectress. And yet she could not
      rest these doubts upon any thing distinctly conclusive; it was rather a
      dislike of her patroness's general manners, and a disgust at her masculine
      notions and expressions, that displeased her, than any thing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, Madame Montreville, followed by her black domestic, entered the
      apartment where Hartley and Menie had just parted. It appeared from the
      conversation which follows, that they had from some place of concealment
      overheard the dialogue we have narrated in the former chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is good luck, Sadoc,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;that there is in this world the
      great fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the great villain,&rdquo; answered Sadoc, in good English, but in a most
      sullen tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This woman, now,&rdquo; continued the lady, &ldquo;is what in Frangistan you call an
      angel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and I have seen those in Hindostan you may well call devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure that this&mdash;how you call him&mdash;Hartley, is a meddling
      devil. For what has he to do? She will not have any of him. What is his
      business who has her? I wish we were well up the Ghauts again, my dear
      Sadoc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; answered the slave, &ldquo;I am half determined never to ascend
      the Ghauts more. Hark you, Adela, I begin to sicken of the plan we have
      laid. This creature's confiding purity&mdash;call her angel or woman, as
      you will&mdash;makes my practices appear too vile, even in my own eyes. I
      feel myself unfit to be your companion farther in the daring paths which
      you pursue. Let us part, and part friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen, coward. But the woman remains with me,&rdquo; answered the Queen of
      Sheba. [Footnote: In order to maintain uninjured the tone of passion
      throughout this dialogue, it has been judged expedient to discard, in the
      Language of the Begum, the <i>patois</i> of Madame Munreville.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With thee!&rdquo; replied the seeming black&mdash;&ldquo;never. No, Adela. She is
      under the shadow of the British flag, and she shall experience its
      protection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and what protection will it afford to you yourself?&rdquo; retorted
      the Amazon. &ldquo;What if I should clap my hands, and command a score of my
      black servants to bind you like a sheep, and then send word to the
      Governor of the Presidency that one Richard Middlemas, who had been guilty
      of mutiny, murder, desertion, and serving of the enemy against his
      countrymen, is here, at Ram Sing Cottah's house, in the disguise of a
      black servant?&rdquo; Middlemas covered his face with his hands, while Madame
      Montreville proceeded to load him with reproaches.&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;slave and son of a slave! Since you wear the dress of my household, you
      shall obey me as fully as the rest of them, otherwise,&mdash;whips,
      fetters,&mdash;the scaffold, renegade,&mdash;the gallows, murderer! Dost
      thou dare to reflect on the abyss of misery from which I raised thee, to
      share my wealth and my affections? Dost thou not remember that the picture
      of this pale, cold, unimpassioned girl was then so indifferent to thee,
      that thou didst sacrifice it as a tribute due to the benevolence of her
      who relieved thee, to the affection of her who, wretch as thou art,
      condescended to love thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, fell woman,&rdquo; answered Middlemas, &ldquo;but was it I who encouraged the
      young tyrant's outrageous passion for a portrait, or who formed the
      abominable plan of placing the original within his power?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;for to do so required brain and wit. But it was thine, flimsy
      villain, to execute the device which a bolder genius planned; it was thine
      to entice the woman to this foreign shore, under pretence of a love,
      which, on thy part, cold-blooded miscreant, never had existed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace, screech-owl!&rdquo; answered Middlemas, &ldquo;nor drive me to such madness as
      may lead me to forget thou art a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman, dastard! Is this thy pretext for sparing me?&mdash;what, then,
      art thou, who tremblest at a woman's looks, a woman's words?&mdash;I am a
      woman, renegade, but one who wears a dagger, and despises alike thy
      strength and thy courage. I am a woman who has looked on more dying men
      than thou hast killed deer and antelopes. Thou must traffic for greatness?&mdash;thou
      hast thrust thyself like a five-years' child, into the rough sports of
      men, and wilt only be borne down and crushed for thy pains. Thou wilt be a
      double traitor, forsooth&mdash;betray thy betrothed to the Prince, in
      order to obtain the means of betraying the Prince to the English, and thus
      gain thy pardon from thy countrymen. But me thou shalt not betray. I will
      not be made the tool of thy ambition&mdash;I will not give thee the aid of
      my treasures and my soldiers, to be sacrificed at last to this northern
      icicle. No, I will watch thee as the fiend watches the wizard. Show but a
      symptom of betraying me while we are here, and I denounce thee to the
      English, who might pardon the successful villain, but not him who can only
      offer prayers for his life, in place of useful services. Let me see thee
      flinch when we are beyond the Ghauts, and the Nawaub shall know thy
      intrigues with the Nizam and the Mahrattas, and thy resolution to deliver
      up Bangalore to the English, when the imprudence of Tippoo shall have made
      thee Killedar. Go where thou wilt, slave, thou shalt find me thy
      mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a fair though an unkind one,&rdquo; said the counterfeit Sadoc, suddenly
      changing his tone to an affectation of tenderness. &ldquo;It is true I pity this
      unhappy woman; true I would save her if I could&mdash;but most unjust to
      suppose I would in any circumstances prefer her to my Nourjehan, my light
      of the world, my Mootee Mahul, my pearl of the palace&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All false coin and empty compliment,&rdquo; said the Begum. &ldquo;Let me hear, in
      two brief words, that you leave this woman to my disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not to be interred alive under your seat, like the Circassian of whom
      you were jealous,&rdquo; said Middlemas, shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, fool; her lot shall not be worse than that of being the favourite of
      a prince. Hast thou, fugitive and criminal as thou art, a better fate to
      offer her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; replied Middlemas, blushing even through his base disguise at the
      consciousness of his abject conduct, &ldquo;I will have no force on her
      inclinations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such truce she shall have as the laws of the Zenana allow,&rdquo; replied the
      female tyrant. &ldquo;A week is long enough for her to determine whether she
      will be the willing mistress of a princely and generous lover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;and before that week expires&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;He stopped
      short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will happen before the week expires?&rdquo; said the Begum Montreville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter&mdash;nothing of consequence. I leave the woman's fate with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis well&mdash;we march to-night on our return, so soon as the moon
      rises Give orders to our retinue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To hear is to obey,&rdquo; replied the seeming slave, and left the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the Begum remained fixed on the door through which he had
      passed. &ldquo;Villain&mdash;double-dyed villain!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I see thy drift;
      thou wouldst betray Tippoo, in policy alike and in love. But me thou canst
      betray.&mdash;Ho, there, who waits? Let a trusty messenger be ready to set
      off instantly with letters, which I will presently make ready. His
      departure must be a secret to every one.&mdash;And now shall this pale
      phantom soon know her destiny, and learn what it is to have rivalled Adela
      Montreville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the Amazonian Princess meditated plans of vengeance against her
      innocent rival and the guilty lover, the latter plotted as deeply for his
      own purposes. He had waited until such brief twilight as India enjoys
      rendered his disguise complete, then set out in haste for the part of
      Madras inhabited by the Europeans, or, as it is termed, Fort St. George.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will save her yet,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;ere Tippoo can seize his prize, we will
      raise around his ears a storm which would drive the God of War from the
      arms of the Goddess of Beauty. The trap shall close its fangs upon this
      Indian tiger, ere he has time to devour the bait which enticed him into
      the snare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Middlemas cherished these hopes, he approached the Residency. The
      sentinel on duty stopped him, as of course, but he was in possession of
      the counter-sign, and entered without opposition. He rounded the building
      in which the President of the Council resided, an able and active, but
      unconscientious man, who, neither in his own affairs, nor in those of the
      Company, was supposed to embarrass himself much about the means which he
      used to attain his object. A tap at a small postern gate was answered by a
      black slave, who admitted Middlemas to that necessary appurtenance of
      every government, a back stair, which, in its turn, conducted him to the
      office of the Bramin Paupiah, the Dubash, or steward of the great man, and
      by whose means chiefly he communicated with the native courts, and carried
      on many mysterious intrigues, which he did not communicate to his brethren
      at the council-board.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is perhaps justice to the guilty and unhappy Middlemas to suppose, that
      if the agency of a British officer had been employed, he might have been
      induced to throw himself on his mercy, might have explained the whole of
      his nefarious bargain with Tippoo, and, renouncing his guilty projects of
      ambition, might have turned his whole thoughts upon saving Menie Gray, ere
      she was transported beyond the reach of British protection. But the thin
      dusky form which stood before him, wrapped in robes of muslin embroidered
      with gold, was that of Paupiah, known as a master-counsellor of dark
      projects, an Oriental Machiavel, whose premature wrinkles were the result
      of many an intrigue, in which the existence of the poor, the happiness of
      the rich, the honour of men, and the chastity of women, had been
      sacrificed without scruple, to attain some private or political advantage.
      He did not even enquire by what means the renegade Briton proposed to
      acquire that influence with Tippoo which might enable him to betray him&mdash;he
      only desired to be assured that the fact was real.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak at the risk of your head, if you deceive Paupiah, or make
      Paupiah the means of deceiving his master. I know, so does all Madras,
      that the Nawaub has placed his young son, Tippoo, as Vice-Regent of his
      newly-conquered territory of Bangalore, which Hyder hath lately added to
      his dominions. But that Tippoo should bestow the government of that
      important place on an apostate Feringi, seems more doubtful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tippoo is young,&rdquo; answered Middlemas, &ldquo;and to youth the temptation of the
      passions is what a lily on the surface of the lake is to childhood&mdash;they
      will risk life to reach it, though, when obtained, it is of little value.
      Tippoo has the cunning of his father and his military talents, but he
      lacks his cautious wisdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou speakest truth&mdash;but when thou art Governor of Bangalore, hast
      thou forces to hold the place till thou art relieved by the Mahrattas, or
      by the British?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubt it not&mdash;the soldiers of the Begum Mootee Mahul, whom the
      Europeans call Montreville, are less hers than mine. I am myself her
      Bukshee, [General,] and her Sirdars are at my devotion. With these I could
      keep Bangalore for two months, and the British army may be before it in a
      week. What do you risk by advancing General Smith's army nearer to the
      frontier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We risk a settled peace with Hyder,&rdquo; answered Paupiah, &ldquo;for which he has
      made advantageous offers. Yet I say not but thy plan may be most
      advantageous. Thou sayest Tippoo's treasures are in the fort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His treasures and his Zenana; I may even be able to secure his person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That were a goodly pledge,&rdquo; answered the Hindoo minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you consent that the treasures shall be divided to the last rupee, as
      in the scroll?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The share of Paupiah's master is too small,&rdquo; said the Bramin; &ldquo;and the
      name of Paupiah is unnoticed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The share of the Begum may be divided between Paupiah and his master,&rdquo;
       answered Middlemas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Begum will expect her proportion,&rdquo; replied Paupiah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me alone to deal with her,&rdquo; said Middlemas. &ldquo;Before the blow is
      struck, she shall not know of our private treaty, and afterwards her
      disappointment will be of little consequence. And now, remember my
      stipulations&mdash;my rank to be restored&mdash;my full pardon to be
      granted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; replied Paupiah, cautiously, &ldquo;should you succeed. But were you to
      betray what has here passed, I will find the dagger of a Lootie which
      shall reach thee, wert thou sheltered under the folds of the Nawaub's
      garment. In the meantime, take this missive, and when you are in
      possession of Bangalore, despatch it to General Smith, whose division
      shall have orders to approach as near the frontiers of Mysore as may be,
      without causing suspicion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus parted this worthy pair; Paupiah to report to his principal the
      progress of these dark machinations, Middlemas to join the Begum, on her
      return to the Mysore. The gold and diamonds of Tippoo, the importance
      which he was about to acquire, the ridding himself at once of the
      capricious authority of the irritable Tippoo, and the troublesome claims
      of the Begum, were such agreeable subjects of contemplation, that he
      scarcely thought of the fate of his European victim,&mdash;unless to salve
      his conscience with the hope that the sole injury she could sustain might
      be the alarm of a few days, during the course of which he would acquire
      the means of delivering her from the tyrant, in whose Zenana she was to
      remain a temporary prisoner. He resolved, at the same time, to abstain
      from seeing her till the moment he could afford her protection, justly
      considering the danger which his whole plan might incur, if he again
      awakened the jealousy of the Begum. This he trusted was now asleep; and,
      in the course of their return to Tippoo's camp, near Bangalore, it was his
      study to soothe this ambitious and crafty female by blandishments,
      intermingled with the more splendid prospects of wealth and power to be
      opened to them both, as he pretended, by the success of his present
      enterprise. [Footnote: It is scarce necessary to say, that such things
      could only be acted in the earlier period of our Indian settlements, when
      the check of the Directors was imperfect, and that of the crown did not
      exist. My friend Mr. Fairscribe is of opinion, that there is an
      anachronism in the introduction of Paupiah, the Bramin Dubash of the
      English governor.&mdash;C. C.]

    <h2>
      CHAPTER THE THIRTEENTH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It appears that the jealous and tyrannical Begum did not long suspend her
      purpose of agonizing her rival by acquainting her with her intended fate.
      By prayers or rewards, Menie Gray prevailed on a servant of Ram Sing
      Cottah, to deliver to Hartley the following distracted note:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All is true your fears foretold&mdash;He has delivered me up to a cruel
      woman, who threatens to sell me to the tyrant, Tippoo. Save me if you can&mdash;if
      you have not pity, or cannot give me aid, there is none left upon earth.&mdash;M.
      G.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The haste with which Dr. Hartley sped to the Fort, and demanded an
      audience of the Governor, was defeated by the delays interposed by
      Paupiah.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not suit the plans of this artful Hindoo, that any interruption
      should be opposed to the departure of the Begum and her favourite,
      considering how much the plans of the last corresponded with his own. He
      affected incredulity on the charge, when Hartley complained of an
      Englishwoman being detained in the train of the Begum against her consent,
      treated the complaint of Miss Gray as the result of some female quarrel
      unworthy of particular attention, and when at length he took some steps
      for examining further into the matter, he contrived they should be so
      tardy, that the Begum and her retinue were far beyond the reach of
      interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hartley let his indignation betray him into reproaches against Paupiah, in
      which his principal was not spared. This only served to give the
      impassable Bramin a pretext for excluding him from the Residency, with a
      hint, that if his language continued to be of such an imprudent character,
      he might expect to be removed from Madras, and stationed at some hillfort
      or village among the mountains, where his medical knowledge would find
      full exercise in protecting himself and others from the unhealthiness of
      the climate.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he retired, bursting with ineffectual indignation, Esdale was the first
      person whom Hartley chanced to meet with, and to him, stung with
      impatience, he communicated what he termed the infamous conduct of the
      Governor's Dubash, connived at, as he had but too much reason to suppose,
      by the Governor himself; exclaiming against the want of spirit which they
      betrayed, in abandoning a British subject to the fraud of renegades, and
      the force of a tyrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Esdale listened with that sort of anxiety which prudent men betray when
      they feel themselves like to be drawn into trouble by the discourse of an
      imprudent friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you desire to be personally righted in this matter,&rdquo; said he at
      length, &ldquo;you must apply to Leadenhall Street, where I suspect&mdash;betwixt
      ourselves&mdash;complaints are accumulating fast, both against Paupiah and
      his master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care for neither of them,&rdquo; said Hartley; &ldquo;I need no personal redress&mdash;I
      desire none&mdash;I only want succour for Menie Gray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Esdale, &ldquo;you have only one resource&mdash;you must
      apply to Hyder himself&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Hyder&mdash;to the usurper&mdash;the tyrant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to this usurper and tyrant,&rdquo; answered Esdale, &ldquo;you must be contented
      to apply. His pride is, to be thought a strict administrator of justice;
      and perhaps he may on this, as on other occasions, choose to display
      himself in the light of an impartial magistrate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I go to demand justice at his footstool,&rdquo; said Hartley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so fast, my dear Hartley,&rdquo; answered his friend; &ldquo;first consider the
      risk. Hyder is just by reflection, and perhaps from political
      considerations; but by temperament, his blood is as unruly as ever beat
      under a black skin, and if you do not find him in the vein of judging, he
      is likely enough to be in that of killing. Stakes and bowstrings are as
      frequently in his head as the adjustment of the scales of justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter&mdash;I will instantly present myself at his Durbar. The
      Governor cannot for very shame refuse me letters of credence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never think of asking them,&rdquo; said his more experienced friend; &ldquo;it would
      cost Paupiah little to have them so worded as to induce Hyder to rid our
      sable Dubash, at once and for ever, of the sturdy free-spoken Dr. Adam
      Hartley. A Vakeel, or messenger of government, sets out to-morrow for
      Seringapatam; contrive to join him on the road, his passport will protect
      you both. Do you know none of the chiefs about Hyder's person?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, excepting his late emissary to this place, Barak el Hadgi,&rdquo;
       answered Hartley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His support,&rdquo; said Esdale, &ldquo;although only a Fakir, may be as effectual as
      that of persons of more essential consequence. And, to say the truth,
      where the caprice of a despot is the question in debate, there is no
      knowing upon what it is best to reckon.&mdash;Take my advice, my dear
      Hartley, leave this poor girl to her fate. After all, by placing yourself
      in an attitude of endeavouring to save her, it is a hundred to one that
      you only ensure your own destruction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hartley shook his head, and bade Esdale hastily farewell; leaving him in
      the happy and self-applauding state of mind proper to one who has given
      the best advice possible to a friend, and may conscientiously wash his
      hands of all consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having furnished himself with money, and with the attendance of three
      trusty native servants, mounted like himself on Arab horses, and carrying
      with them no tent, and very little baggage, the anxious Hartley lost not a
      moment in taking the road to Mysore, endeavouring, in the meantime, by
      recollecting every story he had ever heard of Hyder's justice and
      forbearance, to assure himself that he should find the Nawaub disposed to
      protect a helpless female, even against, the future heir of his empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he crossed the Madras territory, he overtook the Vakeel, or
      messenger of the British Government, of whom Esdale had spoken. This man,
      accustomed for a sum of money to permit adventurous European traders who
      desired to visit Hyder's capital, to share his protection, passport, and
      escort, was not disposed to refuse the same good office to a gentleman of
      credit at Madras; and, propitiated by an additional gratuity, undertook to
      travel as speedily as possible. It was a journey which was not prosecuted
      without much fatigue and considerable danger, as they had to traverse a
      country frequently exposed to all the evils of war, more especially when
      they approached the Ghauts, those tremendous mountain-passes which descend
      from the table-land of Mysore, and through which the mighty streams that
      arise in the centre of the Indian peninsula, find their way to the ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had set ere the party reached the foot of one of these perilous
      passes, up which lay the road to Seringapatam. A narrow path, which in
      summer resembled an empty water-course, winding upwards among immense
      rocks and precipices, was at one time completely overshadowed by dark
      groves of teak-trees, and at another, found its way beside impenetrable
      jungles, the habitation of jackals and tigers.
    </p>
    <p>
      By means of this unsocial path the travellers threaded their way in
      silence,&mdash;Hartley, whose impatience kept him before the Vakeel,
      eagerly enquiring when the moon would enlighten the darkness, which, after
      the sun's disappearance, closed fast around them. He was answered by the
      natives according to their usual mode of expression, that the moon was in
      her dark side, and that he was not to hope to behold her bursting through
      a cloud to illuminate the thickets and strata of black and slaty rocks,
      amongst which they were winding. Hartley had therefore no resource, save
      to keep his eye steadily fixed on the lighted match of the Sowar, or
      horseman, who rode before him, which, for sufficient reasons, was always
      kept in readiness to be applied to the priming of the matchlock. The
      vidette, on his part, kept a watchful eye on the Dowrah, a guide supplied
      at the last village, who, having got more than halfway from his own house,
      was much to be suspected of meditating how to escape the trouble of going
      further. [Footnote: In every village the Dowrah, or Guide, is an official
      person, upon the public establishment, and receives a portion of the
      harvest or other revenue, along with the Smith, the Sweeper, and the
      Barber. As he gets nothing from the travellers whom it is his office to
      conduct, he never scruples to shorten his own journey and prolong theirs
      by taking them to the nearest village, without reference to the most
      direct line of route, and sometimes deserts them entirely. If the regular
      Dowrah is sick or absent, no wealth can procure a substitute.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dowrah, on the other hand, conscious of the lighted match and loaded
      gun behind him, hollowed from time to time to show that he was on his
      duty, and to accelerate the march of the travellers. His cries were
      answered by an occasional ejaculation of Ulla from the black soldiers, who
      closed the rear, and who were meditating on former adventures, the
      plundering of a <i>Kaffila</i>, (party of travelling merchants,) or some
      such exploit, or perhaps reflecting that a tiger, in the neighboring
      jungle, might be watching patiently for the last of the party, in order to
      spring upon him, according to his usual practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun, which appeared almost as suddenly as it had left them, served to
      light the travellers in the remainder of the ascent, and called forth from
      the Mahomedans belonging to the party the morning prayer of Alla Akber,
      which resounded in long notes among the rocks and ravines, and they
      continued with better advantage their forced march until the pass opened
      upon a boundless extent of jungle, with a single high mud fort rising
      through the midst of it. Upon this plain rapine and war had suspended the
      labours of industry, and the rich vegetation of the soil had in a few
      years converted a fertile champaign country into an almost impenetrable
      thicket. Accordingly, the banks of a small nullah, or brook, were covered
      with the footmarks of tigers and other animals of prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the travellers stopped to drink, and to refresh themselves and their
      horses; and it was near this spot that Hartley saw a sight which forced
      him to compare the subject which engrossed his own thoughts, with the
      distress that had afflicted another.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a spot not far distant from the brook, the guide called their attention
      to a most wretched looking man, overgrown with hair, who was seated on the
      skin of a tiger. His body was covered with mud and ashes, his skin
      sunburnt, his dress a few wretched tatters. He appeared not to observe the
      approach of the strangers, neither moving nor speaking a word, but
      remaining with his eyes fixed on a small and rude tomb, formed of the
      black slate stones which lay around, and exhibiting a small recess for a
      lamp. As they approached the man, and placed before him a rupee or two,
      and some rice, they observed that a tiger's skull and bones lay beside
      him, with a sabre almost consumed by rust.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they gazed on this miserable object, the guide acquainted them with
      his tragical history. Sadhu Sing had been a Sipahee, or soldier, and
      freebooter of course, the native and the pride of a half-ruined village
      which they had passed on the preceding day. He was betrothed to the
      daughter of a Sipahee, who served in the mud fort which they saw at a
      distance rising above the jungle. In due time, Sadhu, with his friends,
      came for the purpose of the marriage, and to bring home the bride. She was
      mounted on a Tatoo, a small horse belonging to the country, and Sadhu and
      his friends preceded her on foot, in all their joy and pride. As they
      approached the nullah near which the travellers were resting, there was
      heard a dreadful roar, accompanied by a shriek of agony. Sadhu Sing, who
      instantly turned, saw no trace of his bride, save that her horse ran wild
      in one direction, whilst in the other the long grass and reeds of the
      jungle were moving like the ripple of the ocean, when distorted by the
      course of a shark holding its way near the surface. Sadhu drew his sabre
      and rushed forward in that direction; the rest of the party remained
      motionless until roused by a short roar of agony. They then plunged into
      the jungle with their drawn weapons, where they speedily found Sadhu Sing
      holding in his arms the lifeless corpse of his bride, where a little
      farther lay the body of the tiger, slain by such a blow over the neck as
      desperation itself could alone have discharged.&mdash;The brideless
      bridegroom would permit none to interfere with his sorrow. He dug a grave
      for his Mora, and erected over it the rude tomb they saw, and never
      afterwards left the spot. The beasts of prey themselves seemed to respect
      or dread the extremity of his sorrow. His friends brought him food and
      water from the nullah, but he neither smiled nor showed any mark of
      acknowledgment, unless when they brought him flowers to deck the grave of
      Mora. Four or five years, according to the guide, had passed away, and
      there Sadhu Sing still remained among the trophies of his grief and his
      vengeance, exhibiting all the symptoms of advanced age, though still in
      the prime of youth. The tale hastened the travellers from their
      resting-place; the Vakeel because it reminded him of the dangers of the
      jungle, and Hartley because it coincided too well with the probable fate
      of his beloved, almost within the grasp of a more formidable tiger than
      that whose skeleton lay beside Sadhu Sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at the mud fort already mentioned that the travellers received the
      first accounts of the progress of the Begum and her party, by a Peon (or
      foot-soldier) who had been in their company, but was now on his return to
      the coast. They had travelled, he said, with great speed, until they
      ascended the Ghauts, where they were joined by a party of the Begum's own
      forces; and he and others, who had been brought from Madras as a temporary
      escort, were paid and dismissed to their homes. After this, he understood
      it was the purpose of the Begum Mootee Mahul, to proceed by slow marches
      and frequent halts, to Bangalore, the vicinity of which place she did not
      desire to reach until Prince Tippoo, with whom she desired an interview,
      should have returned from an expedition towards Vandicotta, in which he
      had lately been engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the result of his anxious enquiries, Hartley had reason to hope, that
      though Seringapatam was seventy-five miles more to the eastward than
      Bangalore, yet, by using diligence, he might have time to throw himself at
      the feet of Hyder, and beseech his interposition, before the meeting
      betwixt Tippoo and the Begum should decide the fate of Menie Gray. On the
      other hand, he trembled as the Peon told him that the Begum's Bukshee, or
      General, who had travelled to Madras with her in disguise, had now assumed
      the dress and character belonging to his rank, and it was expected he was
      to be honoured by the Mahomedan Prince with some high office of dignity.
      With still deeper anxiety, he learned that a palanquin, watched with
      sedulous care by the slaves of Oriental jealousy, contained, it was
      whispered, a Feringi, or Frankish woman, beautiful as a Houri, who had
      been brought from England by the Begum, as a present to Tippoo. The deed
      of villany was therefore in full train to be accomplished; it remained to
      see whether by diligence on Hartley's side, its course could be
      interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this eager vindicator of betrayed innocence arrived in the capital of
      Hyder, it may be believed that he consumed no time in viewing the temple
      of the celebrated Vishnoo, or in surveying the splendid Gardens called
      Loll-bang, which were the monument of Hyder's magnificence, and now hold
      his mortal remains. On the contrary, he was no sooner arrived in the city,
      than he hastened to the principal Mosque, having no doubt that he was
      there most likely to learn some tidings of Barak el Hadgi. He approached
      accordingly the sacred spot, and as to enter it would have cost a Feringi
      his life, he employed the agency of a devout Mussulman to obtain
      information concerning the person whom he sought. He was not long in
      learning that the Fakir Barak was within the Mosque, as he had
      anticipated, busied with his holy office of reading passages from the
      Koran, and its most approved commentators. To interrupt him in his devout
      task was impossible, and it was only by a high bribe that he could prevail
      on the same Moslem whom he had before employed, to slip into the sleeve of
      the holy man's robe a paper containing his name, and that of the Khan in
      which the Vakeel had taken up his residence. The agent brought back for
      answer, that the Fakir, immersed, as was to be expected, in the holy
      service which he was in the act of discharging, had paid no visible
      attention to the symbol of intimation which the Feringi Sahib [European
      gentleman] had sent to him. Distracted with the loss of time, of which
      each moment was precious, Hartley next endeavoured to prevail on the
      Mussulman to interrupt the Fakir's devotions with a verbal message; but
      the man was indignant at the very proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dog of a Christian!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what art thou and thy whole generation,
      that Barak el Hadgi should lose a divine thought for the sake of an
      infidel like thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Exasperated beyond self-possession, the unfortunate Hartley was now about
      to intrude upon the precincts of the Mosque in person, in hopes of
      interrupting the formal prolonged recitation which issued from its
      recesses, when an old man laid his hand on his shoulder, and prevented him
      from a rashness which might have cost him his life, saying, at the same
      time, &ldquo;You are a Sahib Angrezie, [English gentleman;] I have been a
      Telinga [a private soldier] in the Company's service, and have eaten their
      salt. I will do your errand for you to the Fakir Barak el Hadgi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he entered the Mosque, and presently returned with the Fakir's
      answer, in these enigmatical words:&mdash;&ldquo;He who would see the sun rise
      must watch till the dawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this poor subject of consolation, Hartley retired to his inn, to
      meditate on the futility of the professions of the natives, and to devise
      some other mode of finding access to Hyder than that which he had hitherto
      trusted to. On this point, however, he lost all hope, being informed by
      his late fellow-traveller, whom he found at the Khan, that the Nawaub was
      absent from the city on a secret expedition, which might detain him for
      two or three days. This was the answer which the Vakeel himself had
      received from the Dewan, with a farther intimation, that he must hold
      himself ready, when he was required, to deliver his credentials to Prince
      Tippoo, instead of the Nawaub; his business being referred to the former,
      in a way not very promising for the success of his mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hartley was now nearly thrown into despair. He applied to more than one
      officer supposed to have credit with the Nawaub, but the slightest hint of
      the nature of his business seemed to strike all with terror. Not one of
      the persons he applied to would engage in the affair, or even consent to
      give it a hearing; and the Dewan plainly told him, that to engage in
      opposition to Prince Tippoo's wishes, was the ready way to destruction,
      and exhorted him to return to the coast. Driven almost to distraction by
      his various failures, Hartley betook himself in the evening to the Khan.
      The call of the Muezzins thundering from the minarets, had invited the
      faithful to prayers, when a black servant, about fifteen years old, stood
      before Hartley, and pronounced these words, deliberately, and twice over,&mdash;&ldquo;Thus
      says Barak el Hadgi, the watcher in the Mosque: He that would see the sun
      rise, let him turn towards the east.&rdquo; He then left the caravanserai; and
      it may be well supposed that Hartley, starting from the carpet on which he
      had lain down to repose himself, followed his youthful guide with renewed
      vigour and palpitating hope.

      CHAPTER THE FOURTEENTH.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'Twas the hour when rites unholy
    Call'd each Paynim voice to prayer,
  And the star that faded slowly,
    Left to dews the freshened air.

  Day his sultry fires had wasted,
    Calm and cool the moonbeams shone;
  To the Vizier's lofty palace
    One bold Christian came alone.

    THOMAS CAMPBELL. <i>Quoted from memory.</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      The twilight darkened into night so fast, that it was only by his white
      dress that Hartley could discern his guide, as he tripped along the
      splendid Bazaar of the city. But the obscurity was so far favourable, that
      it prevented the inconvenient attention which the natives might otherwise
      have bestowed upon the European in his native dress, a sight at that time
      very rare in Seringapatam.
    </p>
    <p>
      The various turnings and windings through which he was conducted, ended at
      a small door in a wall, which, from the branches that hung over it, seemed
      to surround a garden or grove.
    </p>
    <p>
      The postern opened on a tap from his guide, and the slave having entered,
      Hartley prepared to follow, but stepped back as a gigantic African
      brandished at his head a scimetar three fingers broad. The young slave
      touched his countryman with a rod which he held in his hand, and it seemed
      as if the touch disabled the giant, whose arm and weapon sunk instantly.
      Hartley entered without farther opposition, and was now in a grove of
      mango-trees, through which an infant moon was twinkling faintly amid the
      murmur of waters, the sweet song of the nightingale, and the odours of the
      rose, yellow jasmine, orange and citron flowers, and Persian narcissus.
      Huge domes and arches, which were seen imperfectly in the quivering light,
      seemed to intimate the neighbourhood of some sacred edifice, where the
      Fakir had doubtless taken up his residence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hartley pressed on with as much haste as he could, and entered a side-door
      and narrow vaulted passage, at the end of which was another door. Here his
      guide stopped, but pointed and made indications that the European should
      enter. Hartley did so, and found himself in a small cell, such as we have
      formerly described, wherein sate Barak el Hadgi, with another Fakir, who,
      to judge from the extreme dignity of a white beard, which ascended up to
      his eyes on each side, must be a man of great sanctity, as well as
      importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hartley pronounced the usual salutation of Salam Alaikum in the most
      modest and deferential tone; but his former friend was so far from
      responding in their former strain of intimacy, that, having consulted the
      eye of his older companion, he barely pointed to a third carpet, upon
      which the stranger seated himself cross-legged, after the country fashion,
      and a profound silence prevailed for the space of several minutes. Hartley
      knew the Oriental customs too well to endanger the success of his suit by
      precipitation. He waited an intimation to speak. At length it came, and
      from Barak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the pilgrim Barak,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;dwelt at Madras, he had eyes and a
      tongue; but now he is guided by those of his father, the holy Scheik Hali
      ben Khaledoun, the superior of his convent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This extreme humility Hartley thought inconsistent with the affectation of
      possessing superior influence, which Barak had shown while at the
      Presidency; but exaggeration of their own consequence is a foible common
      to all who find themselves in a land of strangers. Addressing the senior
      Fakir, therefore, he told him in as few words as possible the villanous
      plot which was laid to betray Menie Gray into the hands of the Prince
      Tippoo. He made his suit for the reverend father's intercession with the
      Prince himself, and with his father the Nawaub, in the most persuasive
      terms. The Fakir listened to him with an inflexible and immovable aspect,
      similar to that with which a wooden saint regards his eager supplicants.
      There was a second pause, when, after resuming his pleading more than
      once, Hartley was at length compelled to end it for want of matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence was broken by the elder Fakir, who, after shooting a glance at
      his younger companion by a turn of the eye, without the least alteration
      of the position of the head and body, said, &ldquo;The unbeliever has spoken
      like a poet. But does he think that the Nawaub Khan Hyder Ali Behauder
      will contest with his son Tippoo the victorious, the possession of an
      infidel slave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hartley received at the same time a side glance from Barak, as if
      encouraging him to plead his own cause. He suffered a minute to elapse,
      and then replied,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Nawaub is in the place of the Prophet, a judge over the low as well
      as high. It is written, that when the Prophet decided a controversy
      between the two sparrows concerning a grain of rice, his wife Fatima said
      to him, 'Doth the Missionary of Allah well to bestow his time in
      distributing justice on a matter so slight, and between such despicable
      litigants?'&mdash;'Know, woman,' answered the Prophet, 'that the sparrows
      and the grain of rice are the creation of Allah. They are not worth more
      than thou hast spoken; but justice is a treasure of inestimable price, and
      it must be imparted by him who holdeth power to all who require it at his
      hand. The Prince doth the will of Allah, who gives it alike in small
      matters as in great, and to the poor as well as the powerful. To the
      hungry bird, a grain of rice is as a chaplet of pearls to a sovereign.'&mdash;I
      have spoken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bismallah!&mdash;Praised be God! he hath spoken like a Moullah,&rdquo; said the
      elder Fakir, with a little more emotion, and some inclination of his head
      towards Barak, for on Hartley he scarcely deigned even to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lips have spoken it which cannot lie,&rdquo; replied Barak, and there was
      again a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was once more broken by Scheick Hali, who, addressing himself directly
      to Hartley, demanded of him, &ldquo;Hast thou heard, Feringi, of aught of
      treason meditated by this Kafr [infidel] against the Nawaub Behander?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of a traitor cometh treason,&rdquo; said Hartley, &ldquo;but, to speak after my
      knowledge, I am not conscious of such design.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is truth in the words of him,&rdquo; said the Fakir, &ldquo;who accuseth not
      his enemy save on his knowledge. The things thou hast spoken shall be laid
      before the Nawaub; and as Allah and he will, so shall the issue be.
      Meantime, return to thy Khan, and prepare to attend the Vakeel of thy
      government, who is to travel with dawn to Bangalore, the strong, the
      happy, the holy city. Peace be with thee!&mdash;Is it not so, my son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barak, to whom this appeal was made, replied, &ldquo;Even as my father hath
      spoken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hartley had no alternative but to arise and take his leave with the usual
      phrase, &ldquo;Salam&mdash;God's peace be with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His youthful guide, who waited his return without, conducted him once more
      to his Khan, through by-paths which he could not have found out without
      pilotage. His thoughts were in the mean time strongly engaged on his late
      interview. He knew the Moslem men of religion were not implicitly to be
      trusted. The whole scene might be a scheme of Barak, to get rid of the
      trouble of patronizing a European in a delicate affair; and he determined
      to be guided by what should seem to confirm or discredit the intimation
      which he had received.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his arrival at the Khan, he found the Vakeel of the British government
      in a great bustle, preparing to obey directions transmitted to him by the
      Nawaub's Dewan, or treasurer, directing him to depart the next morning
      with break of day for Bangalore.
    </p>
    <p>
      He expressed great discontent at the order, and when Hartley intimated his
      purpose of accompanying him, seemed to think him a fool for his pains,
      hinting the probability that Hyder meant to get rid of them both by means
      of the freebooters, through whose countries they were to pass with such a
      feeble escort. This fear gave way to another, when the time of departure
      came, at which moment there rode up about two hundred of the Nawaub's
      native cavalry. The Sirdar who commanded these troops behaved with
      civility, and stated that he was directed to attend upon the travellers,
      and to provide for their safety and convenience on the journey; but his
      manner was reserved and distant, and the Vakeel insisted that the force
      was intended to prevent their escape, rather than for their protection.
      Under such unpleasant auspices, the journey between Seringapatam and
      Bangalore was accomplished in two days and part of a third, the distance
      being nearly eighty miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving in view of this fine and populous city, they found an
      encampment already established within a mile of its walls. It occupied a
      tope or knoll, covered with trees, and looked full on the gardens which
      Tippoo had created in one quarter of the city. The rich pavilions of the
      principal persons flamed with silk and gold; and spears with gilded
      points, or poles supporting gold knobs, displayed numerous little banners
      inscribed with the name of the Prophet. This was the camp of the Begum
      Mootee Mahul, who, with a small body of her troops, about two hundred men,
      was waiting the return of Tippoo under the walls of Bangalore. Their
      private motives for desiring a meeting the reader is acquainted with; to
      the public the visit of the Begum had only the appearance of an act of
      deference, frequently paid by inferior and subordinate princes to the
      patrons whom they depend upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      These facts ascertained, the Sirdar of the Nawaub took up his own
      encampment within sight of that of the Begum, but at about half a mile's
      distance, despatching to the city a messenger to announce to the Prince
      Tippoo, as soon as he should arrive, that he had come hither with the
      English Vakeel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bustle of pitching a few tents was soon over, and Hartley, solitary
      and sad, was left to walk under the shade of two or three mango-trees, and
      looking to the displayed streamers of the Begum's encampment, to reflect
      that amid these insignia of Mahomedanism Menie Gray remained, destined by
      a profligate and treacherous lover to the fate of slavery to a heathen
      tyrant. The consciousness of being in her vicinity added to the bitter
      pangs with which Hartley contemplated her situation, and reflected how
      little chance there appeared of his being able to rescue her from it by
      the mere force of reason and justice, which was all he could oppose to the
      selfish passions of a voluptuous tyrant. A lover of romance might have
      meditated some means of effecting her release by force or address; but
      Hartley, though a man of courage, had no spirit of adventure, and would
      have regarded as desperate any attempt of the kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sole gleam of comfort arose from the impression which he had
      apparently made upon the elder Fakir, which he could not help hoping might
      be of some avail to him. But on one thing he was firmly resolved, and that
      was not to relinquish the cause he had engaged in whilst a grain of hope
      remained. He had seen in his own profession a quickening and a revival of
      life in the patient's eye, even when glazed apparently by the hand of
      Death; and he was taught confidence amidst moral evil by his success in
      relieving that which was physical only.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Hartley was thus meditating, he was roused to attention by a heavy
      firing of artillery from the high bastions of the town; and turning his
      eyes in that direction, he could see advancing, on the northern side of
      Bangalore, a tide of cavalry, riding tumultuously forward, brandishing
      their spears in all different attitudes, and pressing their horses to a
      gallop. The clouds of dust which attended this vanguard, for such it was,
      combined with the smoke of the guns, did not permit Hartley to see
      distinctly the main body which followed; but the appearance of howdahed
      elephants and royal banners dimly seen through the haze, plainly intimated
      the return of Tippoo to Bangalore; while shouts, and irregular discharges
      of musketry, announced the real or pretended rejoicing of the inhabitants.
      The city gates received the living torrent, which rolled towards them; the
      clouds of smoke and dust were soon dispersed, and the horizon was restored
      to serenity and silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting between persons of importance, more especially of royal rank,
      is a matter of very great consequence in India, and generally much address
      is employed to induce the person receiving the visit, to come as far as
      possible to meet the visitor. From merely rising up, or going to the edge
      of the carpet, to advancing to the gate of the palace, to that of the
      city, or, finally, to a mile or two on the road, is all subject to
      negotiation. But Tippoo's impatience to possess the fair European induced
      him to grant on this occasion a much greater degree of courtesy than the
      Begum had dared to expect, and he appointed his garden, adjacent to the
      city walls, and indeed included within the precincts of the
      fortifications, as the place of their meeting; the hour noon, on the day
      succeeding his arrival; for the natives seldom move early in the morning,
      or before having broken their fast. This was intimated to the Begum's
      messenger by the Prince in person, as, kneeling before him, he presented
      the <i>mizzar</i>, (a tribute consisting of three, five, or seven gold
      Mohurs, always an odd number,) and received in exchange a khelaut, or
      dress of honour. The messenger, in return, was eloquent in describing the
      importance of his mistress, her devoted veneration for the Prince, the
      pleasure which she experienced on the prospect of their motakul, or
      meeting, and concluded with a more modest compliment to his own
      extraordinary talents, and the confidence which the Begum reposed in him.
      He then departed; and orders were given that on the next day all should be
      in readiness for the <i>Sowarree</i>, a grand procession, when the Prince
      was to receive the Begum as his honoured guest at his pleasure-house in
      the gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before the appointed hour, the rendezvous of Fakirs, beggars, and
      idlers, before the gate of the palace, intimated the excited expectations
      of those who usually attend processions; while a more urgent set of
      mendicants, the courtiers, were hastening thither, on horses or elephants,
      as their means afforded, always in a hurry to show their zeal, and with a
      speed proportioned to what they hoped or feared.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon precisely, a discharge of cannon, placed in the outer courts, as
      also of match-locks and of small swivels, carried by camels, (the poor
      animals shaking their long ears at every discharge,) announced that Tippoo
      had mounted his elephant. The solemn and deep sound of the naggra, or
      state drum, borne upon an elephant, was then heard like the distant
      discharge of artillery, followed by a long roll of musketry, and was
      instantly answered by that of numerous trumpets and tom-toms, (or common
      drums,) making a discordant, but yet a martial din. The noise increased as
      the procession traversed the outer courts of the palace in succession, and
      at length issued from the gates, having at their head the Chobdars,
      bearing silver sticks and clubs, and shouting, at the pitch of their
      voices, the titles and the virtues of Tippoo, the great, the generous, the
      invincible&mdash;strong as Rustan, just as Noushirvan&mdash;with a short
      prayer for his continued health.
    </p>
    <p>
      After these came a confused body of men on foot, bearing spears,
      match-locks, and banners, and intermixed with horsemen, some in complete
      shirts of mail, with caps of steel under their turbans, some in a sort of
      defensive armour, consisting of rich silk dresses, rendered sabre proof by
      being stuffed with cotton. These champions preceded the Prince, as whose
      body guards they acted. It was not till after this time that Tippoo raised
      his celebrated Tiger-regiment, disciplined and armed according to the
      European fashion. Immediately before the Prince came, on a small elephant,
      A hard-faced, severe-looking man, by office the distributor of alms, which
      he flung in showers of small copper money among the Fakirs and beggars,
      whose scrambles to collect them seemed to augment their amount; while the
      grim-looking agent of Mahomedan charity, together with his elephant, which
      marched with half angry eyes, and its trunk curled upwards, seemed both
      alike ready to chastise those whom poverty should render too importunate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tippoo himself next appeared, richly apparelled, and seated on an
      elephant, which, carrying its head above all the others in the procession,
      seemed proudly conscious of superior dignity. The howdah, or seat which
      the Prince occupied, was of silver, embossed and gilt, having behind a
      place for a confidential servant, who waved the great chowry, or cow-tail,
      to keep off the flies; but who could also occasionally perform the task of
      spokesman, being well versed in all terms of flattery and compliment. The
      caparisons of the royal elephant were of scarlet cloth, richly embroidered
      with gold. Behind Tippoo came the various courtiers and officers of the
      household, mounted chiefly on elephants, all arrayed in their most
      splendid attire, and exhibiting the greatest pomp.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this manner the procession advanced down the principal street of the
      town, to the gate of the royal gardens. The houses were ornamented by
      broad cloth, silk shawls, and embroidered carpets of the richest colours,
      displayed from the verandahs and windows; even the meanest hut was adorned
      with some piece of cloth, so that the whole street had a singularly rich
      and gorgeous appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This splendid procession having entered the royal gardens, approached,
      through a long avenue of lofty trees, a chabootra, or platform of white
      marble, canopied by arches of the same material, which occupied the
      centre. It was raised four or five feet from the ground, covered with
      white cloth and Persian carpets. In the centre of the platform was the
      musnud, or state cushion of the prince, six feet square, composed of
      crimson velvet, richly embroidered. By special grace, a small low cushion
      was placed on the right of the Prince, for the occupation of the Begum. In
      front of this platform was a square tank, or pond of marble, four feet
      deep, and filled to the brim, with water as clear as crystal, having a
      large jet or fountain in the middle, which threw up a column of it to the
      height of twenty feet.
    </p>

      The Prince Tippoo had scarcely dismounted from his elephant, and occupied
      the musnod, or throne of cushions, when the stately form of the Begum was
      seen advancing to the place of rendezvous. The elephant being left at the
      gate of the gardens opening into the country, opposite to that by which
      the procession of Tippoo had entered, she was carried in an open litter,
      richly ornamented with silver, and borne on the shoulders of six black
      slaves. Her person was as richly attired as silks and gems could
      accomplish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard Middlemas, as the Begum's General or Bukshee, walked nearest to
      her litter, in a dress as magnificent in itself as it was remote from all
      European costume, being that of a Banka, or Indian courtier. His turban
      was of rich silk and gold, twisted very hard and placed on one side of his
      head, its ends hanging down on the shoulder. His mustaches were turned and
      curled, and his eyelids stained with antimony. The vest was of gold
      brocade, with a cummerband, or sash, around his waist, corresponding to
      his turban. He carried in his hand a large sword, sheathed in a scabbard
      of crimson velvet, and wore around his middle a broad embroidered
      sword-belt. What thoughts he had under this gay attire, and the bold
      bearing which corresponded to it, it would be fearful to unfold. His least
      detestable hopes were perhaps those which tended to save Menie Gray, by
      betraying the Prince who was about to confide in him, and the Begum, at
      whose intercession Tippoo's confidence was to be reposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The litter stopped as it approached the tank, on the opposite side of
      which the Prince was seated on his musnud. Middlemas assisted the Begum to
      descend, and led her, deeply veiled with silver muslin, towards the
      platform of marble. The rest of the retinue of the Begum followed in their
      richest and most gaudy attire, all males, however; nor was there a symptom
      of woman being in her train, except that a close litter, guarded by twenty
      black slaves, having their sabres drawn, remained at some distance in a
      thicket of flowering shrubs.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Tippoo Saib, through the dim haze which hung over the Waterfall,
      discerned the splendid train of the Begum advancing, he arose from his
      musnud, so as to receive her near the foot of his throne, and exchanged
      greetings with her upon the pleasure of meeting, and enquiries after their
      mutual health. He then conducted her to the cushion placed near to his
      own, while his courtiers anxiously showed their politeness in
      accommodating those of the Begum with places upon the carpets around,
      where they all sat down cross-legged&mdash;Richard Middlemas occupying a
      conspicuous situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people of inferior note stood behind, and amongst them was the Sirdar
      of Hyder Ali, with Hartley and the Madras Vakeel. It would be impossible
      to describe the feelings with which Hartley recognized the apostate
      Middlemas and the Amazonian Mrs. Montreville. The sight of them worked up
      his resolution to make an appeal against them in full Durbar, to the
      justice which Tippoo was obliged to render to all who should complain of
      injuries. In the meanwhile, the Prince, who had hitherto spoken in a low
      voice, while acknowledging, it is to be supposed, the service and the
      fidelity of the Begum, now gave the sign to his attendant, who said, in an
      elevated tone, &ldquo;Wherefore, and to requite these services, the mighty
      Prince, at the request of the mighty Begum, Mootee Mahul, beautiful as the
      moon, and wise as the daughter of Giamschid, had decreed to take into his
      service the Bukshee of her armies, and to invest him, as one worthy of all
      confidence, with the keeping of his beloved capital of Bangalore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice of the crier had scarce ceased, when it was answered by one as
      loud, which sounded from the crowd of bystanders, &ldquo;Cursed is he who maketh
      the robber Leik his treasurer, or trusteth the lives of Moslemah to the
      command of an apostate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With unutterable satisfaction, yet with trembling doubt and anxiety,
      Hartley traced the speech to the elder Fakir, the companion of Barak.
      Tippoo seemed not to notice the interruption, which passed for that of
      some mad devotee, to whom the Moslem princes permit great freedoms. The
      Durbar, therefore, recovered from their surprise; and, in answer to the
      proclamation, united in the shout of applause which is expected to attend
      every annunciation of the royal pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their acclamation had no sooner ceased than Middlemas arose, bent himself
      before the musnud, and, in a set speech, declared his unworthiness of such
      high honour as had now been conferred, and his zeal for the Prince's
      service. Something remained to be added, but his speech faltered, his
      limbs shook, and his tongue seemed to refuse its office.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Begum started from her seat, though contrary to etiquette, and said,
      as if to supply the deficiency in the speech of her officer, &ldquo;My slave
      would say, that in acknowledgment of so great an honour conferred on my
      Bukshee, I am so void of means, that I can only pray your Highness will
      deign to accept a lily from Frangistan, to plant within the recesses of
      the secret garden of thy pleasures. Let my lord's guards carry yonder
      litter to the Zenana.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A female scream&mdash;was heard, as, at the signal from Tippoo, the guards
      of his seraglio advanced to receive the closed litter from the attendants
      of the Begum. The voice of the old Fakir was heard louder and sterner than
      before.&mdash;&ldquo;Cursed is the Prince who barters justice for lust! He shall
      die in the gate by the sword of the stranger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is too insolent!&rdquo; said Tippoo. &ldquo;Drag forward that Fakir, and cut his
      robe into tatters on his back with your chabouks.&rdquo; [Footnote: Long whips.]
    </p>
    <p>
      But a scene ensued like that in the hall of Seyd. All who attempted to
      obey the command of the incensed despot fell back from the Fakir, as they
      would from the Angel of Death. He flung his cap and fictitious beard on
      the ground, and the incensed countenance of Tippoo was subdued in an
      instant, when he encountered the stern and awful eye of his father. A sign
      dismissed him from the throne, which Hyder himself ascended, while the
      official menials hastily disrobed him of his tattered cloak, and flung on
      him a robe of regal splendour, and placed on his head a jewelled turban.
      The Durbar rung with acclamations to Hyder Ali Khan Behauder, &ldquo;the good,
      the wise, the discoverer of hidden things, who cometh into the Divan like
      the sun bursting from the clouds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Nawaub at length signed for silence, and was promptly obeyed. He
      looked majestically around him, and at length bent his look upon Tippoo,
      whose downcast eyes, as he stood before the throne with his arms folded on
      his bosom, were strongly contrasted with the haughty air of authority
      which he had worn but a moment before. &ldquo;Thou hast been willing,&rdquo; said the
      Nawaub, &ldquo;to barter the safety of thy capital for the possession of a white
      slave. But the beauty of a fair woman caused Solomon ben David to stumble
      in his path; how much more, then, should the son of Hyder Naig remain firm
      under temptation!&mdash;That men may see clearly, we must remove the light
      which dazzles them. Yonder Feringi woman must be placed at my disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To hear is to obey,&rdquo; replied Tippoo, while the deep gloom on his brow
      showed what his forced submission cost his proud and passionate spirit. In
      the hearts of the courtiers present reigned the most eager curiosity to
      see the <i>denouement</i> of the scene, but not a trace of that wish was
      suffered to manifest itself on features accustomed to conceal all internal
      sensations. The feelings of the Begum were hidden under her veil; while,
      in spite of a bold attempt to conceal his alarm, the perspiration stood in
      large drops on the brow of Richard Middlemas. The next words of the Nawaub
      sounded like music in the ear of Hartley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carry the Feringi woman to the tent of the Sirdar Belash Cassim, [the
      chief to whom Hartley had been committed.] Let her be tended in all
      honour, and let him prepare to escort her, with the Vakeel and the Hakim
      Hartley, to the Payeen-Ghaut, [the country beneath the passes,] answering
      for their safety with his head.&rdquo; The litter was on its road to the
      Sirdar's tents ere the Nawaub had done speaking. &ldquo;For thee, Tippoo,&rdquo;
       continued Hyder, &ldquo;I am not come hither to deprive thee of authority, or to
      disgrace thee before the Durbar. Such things as thou hast promised to this
      Feringi, proceed to make them good. The sun calleth not back the splendour
      which he lends to the moon; and the father obscures not the dignity which
      he has conferred on the son. What thou hast promised, that do thou proceed
      to make good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ceremony of investiture was therefore recommenced, by which the Prince
      Tippoo conferred on Middlemas the important government of the city of
      Bangalore, probably with the internal resolution, that since he was
      himself deprived of the fair European, he would take an early opportunity
      to remove the new Killedar from his charge; while Middlemas accepted it
      with the throbbing hope that he might yet outwit both father and son. The
      deed of investiture was read aloud&mdash;the robe of honour was put upon
      the newly created Killedar, and a hundred voices, while they blessed the
      prudent choice of Tippoo, wished the governor good fortune, and victory
      over his enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      A horse was led forward as the Prince's gift. It was a fine steed of the
      Cuttyawar breed, high-crested, with broad hind-quarters; he was of a white
      colour, but had the extremity of his tail and mane stained red. His saddle
      was red velvet, the bridle and crupper studded&mdash;with gilded knobs.
      Two attendants on lesser horses led this prancing animal, one holding the
      lance, and the other the long spear of their patron. The horse was shown
      to the applauding courtiers, and withdrawn in order to be led in state
      through the streets, while the new Killedar should follow on the elephant,
      another present usual on such an occasion, which was next made to advance,
      that the world might admire the munificence of the Prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      The huge animal approached the platform, shaking his large wrinkled head,
      which he raised and sunk, as if impatient, and curling upwards his trunk
      from time to time, as if to show the gulf of his tongueless mouth.
      Gracefully retiring with the deepest obeisance, the Killedar, well pleased
      the audience was finished, stood by the neck of the elephant, expecting
      the conductor of the animal would make him kneel down, that he might
      ascend the gilded howdah, which awaited his occupancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold, Feringi,&rdquo; said Hyder. &ldquo;Thou hast received all that, was promised
      thee by the bounty of Tippoo. Accept now what is the fruit of the justice
      of Hyder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he signed with his finger, and the driver of the elephant
      instantly conveyed to the animal the pleasure of the Nawaub. Curling his
      long trunk around the neck of the ill-fated European, the monster suddenly
      threw the wretch prostrate before him, and stamping his huge shapeless
      foot upon his breast, put an end at once to his life, and to his crimes.
      The cry which the victim uttered was mimicked by the roar of the monster,
      and a sound like an hysterical laugh mingling with a scream, which rung
      from under the veil of the Begum. The elephant once more raised his trunk
      aloft, and gaped fearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The courtiers preserved a profound silence; but Tippoo, upon whose muslin
      robe a part of the victim's blood had spirted, held it up to the Nawaub,
      exclaiming in a sorrowful, yet resentful tone,&mdash;&ldquo;Father&mdash;father&mdash;was
      it thus my promise should have been kept?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know, foolish boy,&rdquo; said Hyder Ali, &ldquo;that the carrion which lies there
      was in a plot to deliver Bangalore to the Feringis and the Mahrattas. This
      Begum [she started when she heard herself named] has given us warning of
      the plot, and has so merited her pardon for having originally concurred in
      it,&mdash;whether altogether out of love to us we will not too curiously
      enquire.&mdash;Hence with that lump of bloody clay, and let the Hakim
      Hartley and the English Vakeel come before me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were brought forward,&mdash;while some of the attendants flung sand
      upon the bloody traces, and others removed the crushed corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hakim,&rdquo; said Hyder, &ldquo;thou shalt return with the Feringi woman, and with
      gold to compensate her injuries,&mdash;wherein the Begum, as is fitting,
      shall contribute a share. Do thou say to thy nation, Hyder Ali acts
      justly.&rdquo; The Nawaub then inclined himself graciously to Hartley, and then
      turning to the Vakeel, who appeared much discomposed, &ldquo;You have brought to
      me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;words of peace,&mdash;while your masters meditated a
      treacherous war. It is not upon such as you that my vengeance ought to
      alight. But tell the Kafr [or infidel] Paupiah and his unworthy master,
      that Hyder Ali sees too clearly to suffer to be lost by treason the
      advantages he has gained by war. Hitherto I have been in the Carnatic as a
      mild Prince&mdash;in future I will be a destroying tempest! Hitherto I
      have made inroads as a compassionate and merciful conqueror&mdash;hereafter
      I will be the messenger whom Allah sends to the kingdoms which he visits
      in judgment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is well known how dreadfully the Nawaub kept this promise, and how he
      and his son afterwards sunk before the discipline and bravery of the
      Europeans. The scene of just punishment which he so faithfully exhibited
      might be owing to his policy, his internal sense of right, and to the
      ostentation of displaying it before an Englishman of sense and
      intelligence, or to all of these motives mingled together&mdash;but in
      what proportions it is not for us to distinguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hartley reached the coast in safety with his precious charge, rescued from
      a dreadful fate when she was almost beyond hope. But the nerves and
      constitution of Menie Gray had received a shock from which she long
      suffered severely, and never entirely recovered. The principal ladies of
      the settlement, moved by the singular tale of her distress, received her
      with the utmost kindness, and exercised towards her the most attentive and
      affectionate hospitality. The Nawaub, faithful to his promise, remitted to
      her a sum of no less than ten thousand gold Mohurs, extorted, as was
      surmised, almost entirely from the hoards of the Begum Mootee Mahul, or
      Montreville. Of the fate of that adventuress nothing was known for
      certainty; but her forts and government were taken into Hyder's custody,
      and report said, that, her power being abolished and her consequence lost,
      she died by poison, either taken by herself, or administered by some other
      person.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might be thought a natural conclusion of the history of Menie Gray,
      that she should have married Hartley, to whom she stood much indebted for
      his heroic interference in her behalf. But her feelings were too much and
      too painfully agitated, her health too much shattered, to permit her to
      entertain thoughts of a matrimonial connexion, even with the acquaintance
      of her youth, and the champion of her freedom. Time might have removed
      these obstacles, but not two years, after their adventures in Mysore, the
      gallant and disinterested Hartley fell a victim to his professional
      courage, in withstanding the progress of a contagious distemper, which he
      at length caught, and under which he sunk. He left a considerable part of
      the moderate fortune which he had acquired to Menie Gray, who, of course,
      did not want for many advantageous offers of a matrimonial character. But
      she respected the memory of Hartley too much, to subdue in behalf of
      another the reasons which induced her to refuse the hand which he had so
      well deserved&mdash;nay, it may be thought, had so fairly won.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned to Britain&mdash;what seldom occurs&mdash;unmarried though
      wealthy; and, settling in her native village, appeared to find her only
      pleasure in acts of benevolence which seemed to exceed the extent of her
      fortune, had not her very retired life been taken into consideration. Two
      or three persons with whom she was intimate, could trace in her character
      that generous and disinterested simplicity and affection, which were the
      ground-work of her character. To the world at large her habits seemed
      those of the ancient Roman matron, which is recorded on her tomb in these
      four words,

      MR. CROFTANGRY'S CONCLUSION
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  If you tell a good jest,
    And please all the rest,
  Comes Dingley, and asks you, &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;
     And before she can know,
  Away she will go
    To seek an old rag in the closet.
                          Dean Swift.
</pre>
    <p>
      While I was inditing the goodly matter which my readers have just perused,
      I might be said to go through a course of breaking-in to stand criticism,
      like a shooting-pony to stand fire. By some of those venial breaches of
      confidence, which always take place on the like occasions, my private
      flirtations with the Muse of Fiction became a matter whispered in Miss
      Fairscribe's circle, some ornaments of which were, I suppose, highly
      interested in the progress of the affair, while others &ldquo;really thought Mr.
      Chrystal Croftangry might have had more wit at his time of day.&rdquo; Then came
      the sly intimation, the oblique remark, all that sugar-lipped raillery
      which is fitted for the situation of a man about to do a foolish thing,
      whether it be to publish or to marry, and that accompanied with the
      discreet nods and winks of such friends as are in the secret, and the
      obliging eagerness of others to know all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the affair became so far public, that I was induced to face a
      tea-party with my manuscript in my pocket, looking as simple and modest as
      any gentleman of a certain age need to do upon such an occasion. When tea
      had been carried round, handkerchiefs and smelling bottles prepared, I had
      the honour of reading the Surgeon's Daughter for the entertainment of the
      evening. It went off excellently; my friend Mr. Fairscribe, who had been
      seduced from his desk to join the literary circle, only fell asleep twice,
      and readily recovered his attention by help of his snuff-box. The ladies
      were politely attentive, and when the cat, or the dog, or a next
      neighbour, tempted an individual to relax, Katie Fairscribe was on the
      alert, like an active whipper-in, with look, touch, or whisper, to recall
      them to a sense of what was going on. Whether Miss Katie was thus active
      merely to enforce the literary discipline of her coterie, or whether she
      was really interested by the beauties of the piece, and desirous to
      enforce them on others, I will not venture to ask, in case I should end in
      liking the girl&mdash;and she is really a pretty one. Better than wisdom
      would warrant, either for my sake or hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must own, my story here and there flagged a good deal; perhaps there
      were faults in my reading, for while I should have been attending to
      nothing but how to give the words effect as they existed, I was feeling
      the chilling consciousness, that they might have been, and ought to have
      been, a great deal better. However, we kindled up at last when we got to
      the East Indies, although on the mention of tigers, an old lady, whose
      tongue had been impatient for an hour, broke in with, &ldquo;I wonder if Mr.
      Croftangry ever heard the story of Tiger Tullideph?&rdquo; and had nearly
      inserted the whole narrative as an episode in my tale. She was, however,
      brought to reason, and the subsequent mention of shawls, diamonds,
      turbans, and cummerbands, had their usual effect in awakening the
      imaginations of the fair auditors. At the extinction of the faithless
      lover in a way so horribly new, I had, as indeed I expected, the good
      fortune to excite that expression of painful interest which is produced by
      drawing in the breath through the compressed lips; nay, one Miss of
      fourteen actually screamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length my task was ended, and the fair circle rained odours upon me, as
      they pelt beaux at the Carnival with sugar-plums, and drench them with
      scented spices. There was &ldquo;Beautiful,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sweetly interesting,&rdquo; and &ldquo;O
      Mr. Croftangry,&rdquo; and &ldquo;How much obliged,&rdquo; and &ldquo;What a delightful evening,&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;O Miss Katie, how could you keep such a secret so long?&rdquo; While the
      dear souls were thus smothering me with rose leaves, the merciless old
      lady carried them all off by a disquisition upon shawls, which she had the
      impudence to say, arose entirely out of my story. Miss Katie endeavoured
      to stop the flow of her eloquence in vain; she threw all other topics out
      of the field, and from the genuine Indian, she made a digression to the
      imitation shawls now made at Paisley, out of real Thibet wool, not to be
      known from the actual Country shawl, except by some inimitable
      cross-stitch in the border. &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said the old lady, wrapping
      herself up in a rich Kashmire, &ldquo;that there is some way of knowing a thing
      that cost fifty guineas from an article that is sold for five; but I
      venture to say there are not one out of ten thousand that would understand
      the difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The politeness of some of the fair ladies would now have brought back the
      conversation to the forgotten subject of our meeting. &ldquo;How could you, Mr.
      Croftangry, collect all these hard words about India?&mdash;you were never
      there?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, madam, I have not had that advantage; but, like the
      imitative operatives of Paisley, I have composed my shawl by incorporating
      into the woof a little Thibet wool, which my excellent friend and
      neighbour, Colonel Mackerris, one of the best fellows who ever trode a
      Highland moor, or dived into an Indian jungle, had the goodness to supply
      me with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My rehearsal, however, though not absolutely and altogether to my taste,
      has prepared me in some measure for the less tempered and guarded sentence
      of the world. So a man must learn to encounter a foil before he confronts
      a sword; and to take up my original simile, a horse must be accustomed to
      a <i>feu de joie</i>, before you can ride him against a volley of balls.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
&ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
